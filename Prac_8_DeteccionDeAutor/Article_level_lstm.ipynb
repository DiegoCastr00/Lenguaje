The main oil futures contract traded in New York has risen almost 50 percent over the past five months to about US$25.50 a barrel.\\n\\\"Takeovers have been a feature of this sector for years and it doesn't seem to matter if the oil price is up or down,\\\" Baker said.\\nBaker said oil companies making the bids have a double positive effect from the oil price rise with increased cash flow and a boost in share prices making it easier for companies to raise equity and debt.\\nRemaining potential targets in the local oil and gas sector were medium-sized groups like Cultus Petroleum Ltd and Petroz NL which have assets in the prospective Timor Sea area.\\nThe sector's largest listed companies, Woodside Petroleum Ltd and Santos Ltd, were unlikely bid targets, analysts said. (A$1 = $0.79)\\n\",\n          \"GTE Corp said on Wednesday that it expects to continue increasing earnings per share by at least 10 percent for the forseeable future, on revenues seen rising six to eight percent per year.\\n\\\"At this point there is nothing on the horizon to suggest we should be backing off from that (earlier forecast),\\\" chief financial officer Michael Kelly told Reuters.\\nGTE earlier reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.78, 10 percent ahead of a year ago and exactly in line with analysts' consensus estimates carried on First Call.  \\nHowever, analysts were pleased by very strong growth in the business fundamentals, which included an industry-leading 7.4 percent rise in access lines and a 20 percent growth in cellular users. The stock was 2-3/4 firmer at 41-3/8 in early afternoon.\\nKelly was delighted with GTE's line growth.  \\\"We just don't see it stopping; its unbelievably strong,\\\" he said.\\nGTE's local calling areas are mostly suburban, where families who telecommute are most likely to live, and where families have adolescent children who need their own lines -- as well as a computer or two in the home needing a line.  \\nOn top of this GTE areas are concentrated in Sunbelt areas like Florida, where economic growth has been very strong, or California, where it is rebounding from recent weakness.\\n\\\"GTE is in a position to grow faster that the regional Bells because of their concentration in suburban markets,\\\" said Bette Massick of Bear Stearns, noting that an end to sales of local operations has unmasked this growth.\\nKelly said that GTE had worked hard to cut its customer turnover -- or churn -- in cellular services, which increases marketing costs substantially.  Targeting high value customers had paid dividends, without hitting overall growth.  \\nAs a result, average monthly bills are $61 per month, $3 above the industry average, and churn has fallen 18 percent from a year ago.  Most customers are now on term contracts.\\n\\\"Our (consumer) bad debt is coming down also,\\\" Kelly said.\\nGTE offers long distance across 31 states, including all the areas where it already offers local service -- a privilege which regional Bells will only be allowed when they have proven their own local calling markets are competitive.\\nIt has already garnered 500,000 customers since it began in March and expects to reach one million soon after the end of 1996 at the expense of the industry's big three players.  \\n\\\"...Most of our business is coming from the three traditional dominant players,\\\" Kelly said.\\nAT&amp;T Corp, MCI Communications Corp and Sprint Corp are the industry's big three.\\nKelly said that the long distance customers gained seemed above average in terms of call duration and spending.\\nGTE in late August began providing customers in Tampa with a single bill for all their GTE cellular, local, long distance and Internet services and will roll this out to new regions as soon as possible.\\nSingle billing has long been desired by the industry as a tool to retain customers, who like the convenience of writing a single monthly check, but few companies have the software in place to support it. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1712\\n\",\n          \"Software giant Microsoft Corp.'s stock dropped more than 4 percent Monday amid indications that a successor to the Windows 95 operating system will be delayed until 1998.\\nThe stock fell $3.875 to $90.125 and was the most active issue on Nasdaq after widespread reports that the Windows 95 update, code-named Memphis, probably would not be released this year as previously anticipated.\\nIndustry analysts said the likely delay of the operating system update would have little financial impact on Microsoft but could reflect a diminishing corporate appetite for frequent software upgrades.\\n\\\"For large organisations, every year and a half to two years is too fast for new versions,\\\" said David Rothschild of brokerage Piper Jaffray. \\\"Every three or four years is more like it.\\\"\\nAnalysts said the delay likely stemmed from the difficulty of integrating into the operating system the upcoming version 4.0 of Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.\\nJonathan Roberts, director of Windows product management for Microsoft, declined to project a release date for Memphis but said computer manufacturers had been told they would not get software code in time for holiday season retail shipments.\\nHe added that it would be \\\"desirable\\\" to synchronize the retail release of the software to coincide roughly with shipments of new computers.\\nRoberts said developers still expected to issue the first major beta test version to customers by June 30 but said computer manufacturers that sell in major retail outlets generally need final code by July to ship for the holiday season.\\nThe Windows 95 update, sometimes referred to as Windows 97 or Windows 9x, will include several performance-related features, most of which are ready. But developers are still working on the new Internet browser, which adds \\\"push\\\" technology and comes hard on the heels of version 3.0 of the browser, a major update released in August.\\nIn \\\"push\\\" technology, computer users can have customised information sent to them over the Internet rather than having to go out on the Net and search for it.\\nWidely publicised security flaws discovered recently in Internet Explorer 3.0 might be part of the reason Microsoft has decided to go slow with the operating system update, some analysts said.\\n\\\"It's fair to say Internet Explorer got a fair amount of heat for the security problem,\\\" said Larry Dietz of Zona Research, an analyst at Zona Research.\\nBut he also said Microsoft could be \\\"throttling back a little\\\" because of resistance to frequent upgrades from corporate users.\\n\\\"Large end-users are in no hurry to spend the dollars,\\\" Dietz said. \\\"Most end-users know there is a tremendous amount of down time that exists any time you putter with people's computers.\\\"\\nMicrosoft's Roberts acknowledged that many corporate users are still making the transition to Windows 95.\\nPiper Jaffray's Rothschild said the Memphis delay would be unlikely to affect Microsoft's earnings or revenues significantly, particularly because the company defers much of the income it gets from operating systems.\\nBut he and other analysts noted the company's stock is still relatively high priced compared with its expected growth.\\n\\\"It's an expensive stock, and whenever you get a whiff of bad news, it's going to behave like this,\\\" said Mike Wallace of UBS Securities. \\\"I dont think it's a big deal.\\\"\\nMicrosoft, which has slipped about 13 percent from its peak of $103.50 in early February, was one of many high-technology stocks that slumped Monday.\\nWhile the shipping date has slipped, Microsoft needs to update the operating system soon if only because its very name advertises the fact that Windows 95 is nearly 2 years old, analysts said.\\nIn addition, Microsoft's financial model requires it to maintain a regular stream of upgrade revenues, said Michael Gartenberg, research director of the Gartner Group consulting and research firm.\\nHe predicted the Memphis system would get a less historically specific name -- perhaps Windows 2000 -- and said Microsoft probably would increase the price for the new operating system relative to that for Windows 95.\\nRoberts declined to comment on the naming or pricing of the product.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"JanLopatka\",\n          \"RobinSidel\",\n          \"MarkBendeich\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Continental, among the U.S. majors, does not have a European partner.\\n\",\n          \"Apple Computer Inc. reported a $708 million second-quarter loss Wednesday, reflecting a charge for the layoff of a third of its employees and weaker sales of its personal computers,\\nApple said, however, that strong sales of new, speedy PCs and laptops and lower expenses would help the company meet its goal of reporting a profit by its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in September.\\nThe Cupertino, Calif.-based computer company's net loss, equivalent to $5.64 a share, for the fiscal quarter ended March 28 compared with a net loss of $740 million, or $5.99 a share, in the year-ago quarter.\\nApple's loss from operations of $186 million, or $1.48 a share, was worse than the consensus industry analyst forecast of $1.22 a share, according to First Call, which tracks analyst forecasts.\\nThe $708 million net loss included a $155 million charge to cover the cost of layoffs and a $375 million charge for the acquisition of software developer Next Software Inc.\\nApple said, however, that it expects to see higher revenue and a reduced operating loss in the third quarter as its restructuring program takes hold. In March, the company said it would lay off 4,100 employees and reorganize operations to cut costs.\\n\\\"Don't open champagne bottles yet, but the process seems to be working,\\\" said Lou Mazzucchelli, analyst at investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York.\\nDuring the quarter, Apple introduced a jazzy laptop and a speedy desktop machine for small businesses, schools and homes. Sales of the new machines have been strong, the company said.\\n\\\"We feel the worst is behind us and our strategy is on track,\\\" Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio said in a telephone conference call with analysts. He said sales will probably increase in the third quarter over the second and that the company probably will meet its goal of being profitable again by the fourth quarter.\\nStill, even with better financial health, Apple faces serious problems, analysts said.\\nThe number of Apple computers shipped worldwide in the second quarter plunged 33 percent to 602,000 units, compared with 892,000 units in the same quarter a year ago. The drop was bigger than most analysts expected.\\nSales in Japan and Europe also were weak, Apple executives said in the conference call.\\n\\\"I want to see a couple of positive quarters before I say they're beginning to turn the corner,\\\" said Michael Kwatinetz, analyst at the DMG Technology Group investment bank in New York.\\nTo keep costs in line with declining sales, Apple in the past year has laid off more than 5,000 employees. The company also has seen its entire management suite change in 15 months.\\nThe uncertainty about the company's future still is keeping customers away from the Mac aisle at stores, analysts said.\\nDataquest, which tracks PC sales worldwide, says Apple's share of the worldwide market fell to 5.2 percent last year from 7.9 percent. The slide left Apple's market share at the lowest point in three years.\\n\",\n          \"Russian oil barons are battling for control of Rosneft, one of the last big energy firms not yet privatised, in a tussle that could alter Western investments in this energy frontier, industry sources said on Monday.\\nThe sources, who asked not to be named, said rival Russian oil company Sibneft, widely known to be controlled by prominent financier and politician Boris Berezovsky, was making a play for Rosneft, the rough diamond of the Russian energy sector.\\n\\\"Berezovsky plans to merge the two companies,\\\" said a highly placed Russian energy official close to the matter. \\\"It's part of a plan to control revenue flows from (Rosneft's) exports.\\\"\\nSibneft spokesman Filipp Murashkov said Rosneft was one of six energy companies Sibneft was considering acquiring but would not say whether the mini-major would actually make a play.\\n\\\"The company's (Sibneft's) management is analysing the possibility of acquiring one of these oil companies and is assessing its overall needs,\\\" he said by telephone. \\\"What that will result in, I cannot tell you now.\\\" He said Sibneft's board would take a decision in coming weeks.\\nRussia's former oil production associations are now independent companies, most of them privatised and many of them among the world's largest in terms of oil reserves.\\nRosneft's key draws are its status as the recipient of state offtake in all production-sharing deals and its significant equity stakes in $40 billion worth of energy projects with foreign oil companies.\\nBut the company has many deadweight liabilities, including dozens of research institutes and defunct equipment producers.\\nStill, Rosneft is part of three deals off Russia's Far East island of Sakhalin requiring total investments from Japanese and U.S. partners of around $22 billion. In Sakhalin-I, due to begin output right after the turn of the century, one Rosneft unit has a 17 percent interest while a second affiliate has 23 percent.\\nRosneft also has a 7.5 percent stake in the $2 billion Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which will build a new oil export pipeline from Kazakhstan to Russia, and a 20 percent stake in the $20 billion international Timan-Pechora Company project.\\n\\\"This is more than just a corporate battle,\\\" said one of the Russian sources. \\\"Rosneft is going to start reeking of money very soon, and Sibneft's owner senses this.\\\"\\nRosneft's privileged position could introduce a new variable into the tortuous negotiations foreign energy firms go through to try to get oil deals in Russia off the ground.\\nA senior Western energy executive said Rosneft's status as representative of the government in output-sharing deals was unclear and he was unsure of its effect on stalled projects.\\nOne of the Russian sources said Rosneft had once been in preliminary talks with Exxon Corp, Amoco Corp and Total of France on possible strategic alliances but that talks could not proceed until Rosneft's fate was decided.\\n\\\"For the (international) majors, Rosneft is not a hypothetical partner now,\\\" the source said.\\nBerezovsky, through Rosneft's new, government-appointed president, Yuri Bespalov, has undertaken a sweeping overhaul of Rosneft managers, replacing half a dozen powerful department heads, including Valentin Zlatov, who oversaw exports. Rosneft vice-presidents and deputy chairmen are no longer empowered to conduct negotiations with foreign partners or to sign contracts.\\nSources said Sibneft, whose main production unit is Noyabrskneftegaz, was positioning, possibly through an unknown affiliate, to place a winning bid for Rosneft in a forthcoming auction of the company's shares.\\n\\\"I keep hearing from many Russians that Berezovsky is definitely going for Rosneft,\\\" said the Western oil executive. \\\"There is a sense now that it's much more certain.\\\"\\nMoscow has held sales of prize stakes in privatised oil companies but nearly all of them have been won by what appear to be pre-determined winners allied with the company being sold.\\nThe original privatisation plan for Rosneft, Russia's 10th largest producer with 1996 output of 262,000 barrels per day, calls for 47 percent to be auctioned off. The state would retain 51 percent while workers would get two percent.\\nRosneft, which Moscow once envisioned as Russia's national oil company, has wanted to emulate the success of its private competitors, like LUKoil. Senior Rosneft officials once begged to be described as a private oil company, even though it is still 100 percent state-owned.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"JoeOrtiz\",\n          \"GrahamEarnshaw\",\n          \"MartinWolk\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"hopeful_test\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The main oil futures contract traded in New York has risen almost 50 percent over the past five months to about US$25.50 a barrel.\\n\\\"Takeovers have been a feature of this sector for years and it doesn't seem to matter if the oil price is up or down,\\\" Baker said.\\nBaker said oil companies making the bids have a double positive effect from the oil price rise with increased cash flow and a boost in share prices making it easier for companies to raise equity and debt.\\nRemaining potential targets in the local oil and gas sector were medium-sized groups like Cultus Petroleum Ltd and Petroz NL which have assets in the prospective Timor Sea area.\\nThe sector's largest listed companies, Woodside Petroleum Ltd and Santos Ltd, were unlikely bid targets, analysts said. (A$1 = $0.79)\\n\",\n          \"GTE Corp said on Wednesday that it expects to continue increasing earnings per share by at least 10 percent for the forseeable future, on revenues seen rising six to eight percent per year.\\n\\\"At this point there is nothing on the horizon to suggest we should be backing off from that (earlier forecast),\\\" chief financial officer Michael Kelly told Reuters.\\nGTE earlier reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.78, 10 percent ahead of a year ago and exactly in line with analysts' consensus estimates carried on First Call.  \\nHowever, analysts were pleased by very strong growth in the business fundamentals, which included an industry-leading 7.4 percent rise in access lines and a 20 percent growth in cellular users. The stock was 2-3/4 firmer at 41-3/8 in early afternoon.\\nKelly was delighted with GTE's line growth.  \\\"We just don't see it stopping; its unbelievably strong,\\\" he said.\\nGTE's local calling areas are mostly suburban, where families who telecommute are most likely to live, and where families have adolescent children who need their own lines -- as well as a computer or two in the home needing a line.  \\nOn top of this GTE areas are concentrated in Sunbelt areas like Florida, where economic growth has been very strong, or California, where it is rebounding from recent weakness.\\n\\\"GTE is in a position to grow faster that the regional Bells because of their concentration in suburban markets,\\\" said Bette Massick of Bear Stearns, noting that an end to sales of local operations has unmasked this growth.\\nKelly said that GTE had worked hard to cut its customer turnover -- or churn -- in cellular services, which increases marketing costs substantially.  Targeting high value customers had paid dividends, without hitting overall growth.  \\nAs a result, average monthly bills are $61 per month, $3 above the industry average, and churn has fallen 18 percent from a year ago.  Most customers are now on term contracts.\\n\\\"Our (consumer) bad debt is coming down also,\\\" Kelly said.\\nGTE offers long distance across 31 states, including all the areas where it already offers local service -- a privilege which regional Bells will only be allowed when they have proven their own local calling markets are competitive.\\nIt has already garnered 500,000 customers since it began in March and expects to reach one million soon after the end of 1996 at the expense of the industry's big three players.  \\n\\\"...Most of our business is coming from the three traditional dominant players,\\\" Kelly said.\\nAT&amp;T Corp, MCI Communications Corp and Sprint Corp are the industry's big three.\\nKelly said that the long distance customers gained seemed above average in terms of call duration and spending.\\nGTE in late August began providing customers in Tampa with a single bill for all their GTE cellular, local, long distance and Internet services and will roll this out to new regions as soon as possible.\\nSingle billing has long been desired by the industry as a tool to retain customers, who like the convenience of writing a single monthly check, but few companies have the software in place to support it. -- New York Newsroom 212 859 1712\\n\",\n          \"Software giant Microsoft Corp.'s stock dropped more than 4 percent Monday amid indications that a successor to the Windows 95 operating system will be delayed until 1998.\\nThe stock fell $3.875 to $90.125 and was the most active issue on Nasdaq after widespread reports that the Windows 95 update, code-named Memphis, probably would not be released this year as previously anticipated.\\nIndustry analysts said the likely delay of the operating system update would have little financial impact on Microsoft but could reflect a diminishing corporate appetite for frequent software upgrades.\\n\\\"For large organisations, every year and a half to two years is too fast for new versions,\\\" said David Rothschild of brokerage Piper Jaffray. \\\"Every three or four years is more like it.\\\"\\nAnalysts said the delay likely stemmed from the difficulty of integrating into the operating system the upcoming version 4.0 of Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.\\nJonathan Roberts, director of Windows product management for Microsoft, declined to project a release date for Memphis but said computer manufacturers had been told they would not get software code in time for holiday season retail shipments.\\nHe added that it would be \\\"desirable\\\" to synchronize the retail release of the software to coincide roughly with shipments of new computers.\\nRoberts said developers still expected to issue the first major beta test version to customers by June 30 but said computer manufacturers that sell in major retail outlets generally need final code by July to ship for the holiday season.\\nThe Windows 95 update, sometimes referred to as Windows 97 or Windows 9x, will include several performance-related features, most of which are ready. But developers are still working on the new Internet browser, which adds \\\"push\\\" technology and comes hard on the heels of version 3.0 of the browser, a major update released in August.\\nIn \\\"push\\\" technology, computer users can have customised information sent to them over the Internet rather than having to go out on the Net and search for it.\\nWidely publicised security flaws discovered recently in Internet Explorer 3.0 might be part of the reason Microsoft has decided to go slow with the operating system update, some analysts said.\\n\\\"It's fair to say Internet Explorer got a fair amount of heat for the security problem,\\\" said Larry Dietz of Zona Research, an analyst at Zona Research.\\nBut he also said Microsoft could be \\\"throttling back a little\\\" because of resistance to frequent upgrades from corporate users.\\n\\\"Large end-users are in no hurry to spend the dollars,\\\" Dietz said. \\\"Most end-users know there is a tremendous amount of down time that exists any time you putter with people's computers.\\\"\\nMicrosoft's Roberts acknowledged that many corporate users are still making the transition to Windows 95.\\nPiper Jaffray's Rothschild said the Memphis delay would be unlikely to affect Microsoft's earnings or revenues significantly, particularly because the company defers much of the income it gets from operating systems.\\nBut he and other analysts noted the company's stock is still relatively high priced compared with its expected growth.\\n\\\"It's an expensive stock, and whenever you get a whiff of bad news, it's going to behave like this,\\\" said Mike Wallace of UBS Securities. \\\"I dont think it's a big deal.\\\"\\nMicrosoft, which has slipped about 13 percent from its peak of $103.50 in early February, was one of many high-technology stocks that slumped Monday.\\nWhile the shipping date has slipped, Microsoft needs to update the operating system soon if only because its very name advertises the fact that Windows 95 is nearly 2 years old, analysts said.\\nIn addition, Microsoft's financial model requires it to maintain a regular stream of upgrade revenues, said Michael Gartenberg, research director of the Gartner Group consulting and research firm.\\nHe predicted the Memphis system would get a less historically specific name -- perhaps Windows 2000 -- and said Microsoft probably would increase the price for the new operating system relative to that for Windows 95.\\nRoberts declined to comment on the naming or pricing of the product.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"JanLopatka\",\n          \"RobinSidel\",\n          \"MarkBendeich\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author_num\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 14,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 49,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          13,\n          39,\n          30\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Continental, among the U.S. majors, does not have a European partner.\\n\",\n          \"Apple Computer Inc. reported a $708 million second-quarter loss Wednesday, reflecting a charge for the layoff of a third of its employees and weaker sales of its personal computers,\\nApple said, however, that strong sales of new, speedy PCs and laptops and lower expenses would help the company meet its goal of reporting a profit by its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in September.\\nThe Cupertino, Calif.-based computer company's net loss, equivalent to $5.64 a share, for the fiscal quarter ended March 28 compared with a net loss of $740 million, or $5.99 a share, in the year-ago quarter.\\nApple's loss from operations of $186 million, or $1.48 a share, was worse than the consensus industry analyst forecast of $1.22 a share, according to First Call, which tracks analyst forecasts.\\nThe $708 million net loss included a $155 million charge to cover the cost of layoffs and a $375 million charge for the acquisition of software developer Next Software Inc.\\nApple said, however, that it expects to see higher revenue and a reduced operating loss in the third quarter as its restructuring program takes hold. In March, the company said it would lay off 4,100 employees and reorganize operations to cut costs.\\n\\\"Don't open champagne bottles yet, but the process seems to be working,\\\" said Lou Mazzucchelli, analyst at investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York.\\nDuring the quarter, Apple introduced a jazzy laptop and a speedy desktop machine for small businesses, schools and homes. Sales of the new machines have been strong, the company said.\\n\\\"We feel the worst is behind us and our strategy is on track,\\\" Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio said in a telephone conference call with analysts. He said sales will probably increase in the third quarter over the second and that the company probably will meet its goal of being profitable again by the fourth quarter.\\nStill, even with better financial health, Apple faces serious problems, analysts said.\\nThe number of Apple computers shipped worldwide in the second quarter plunged 33 percent to 602,000 units, compared with 892,000 units in the same quarter a year ago. The drop was bigger than most analysts expected.\\nSales in Japan and Europe also were weak, Apple executives said in the conference call.\\n\\\"I want to see a couple of positive quarters before I say they're beginning to turn the corner,\\\" said Michael Kwatinetz, analyst at the DMG Technology Group investment bank in New York.\\nTo keep costs in line with declining sales, Apple in the past year has laid off more than 5,000 employees. The company also has seen its entire management suite change in 15 months.\\nThe uncertainty about the company's future still is keeping customers away from the Mac aisle at stores, analysts said.\\nDataquest, which tracks PC sales worldwide, says Apple's share of the worldwide market fell to 5.2 percent last year from 7.9 percent. The slide left Apple's market share at the lowest point in three years.\\n\",\n          \"Russian oil barons are battling for control of Rosneft, one of the last big energy firms not yet privatised, in a tussle that could alter Western investments in this energy frontier, industry sources said on Monday.\\nThe sources, who asked not to be named, said rival Russian oil company Sibneft, widely known to be controlled by prominent financier and politician Boris Berezovsky, was making a play for Rosneft, the rough diamond of the Russian energy sector.\\n\\\"Berezovsky plans to merge the two companies,\\\" said a highly placed Russian energy official close to the matter. \\\"It's part of a plan to control revenue flows from (Rosneft's) exports.\\\"\\nSibneft spokesman Filipp Murashkov said Rosneft was one of six energy companies Sibneft was considering acquiring but would not say whether the mini-major would actually make a play.\\n\\\"The company's (Sibneft's) management is analysing the possibility of acquiring one of these oil companies and is assessing its overall needs,\\\" he said by telephone. \\\"What that will result in, I cannot tell you now.\\\" He said Sibneft's board would take a decision in coming weeks.\\nRussia's former oil production associations are now independent companies, most of them privatised and many of them among the world's largest in terms of oil reserves.\\nRosneft's key draws are its status as the recipient of state offtake in all production-sharing deals and its significant equity stakes in $40 billion worth of energy projects with foreign oil companies.\\nBut the company has many deadweight liabilities, including dozens of research institutes and defunct equipment producers.\\nStill, Rosneft is part of three deals off Russia's Far East island of Sakhalin requiring total investments from Japanese and U.S. partners of around $22 billion. In Sakhalin-I, due to begin output right after the turn of the century, one Rosneft unit has a 17 percent interest while a second affiliate has 23 percent.\\nRosneft also has a 7.5 percent stake in the $2 billion Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which will build a new oil export pipeline from Kazakhstan to Russia, and a 20 percent stake in the $20 billion international Timan-Pechora Company project.\\n\\\"This is more than just a corporate battle,\\\" said one of the Russian sources. \\\"Rosneft is going to start reeking of money very soon, and Sibneft's owner senses this.\\\"\\nRosneft's privileged position could introduce a new variable into the tortuous negotiations foreign energy firms go through to try to get oil deals in Russia off the ground.\\nA senior Western energy executive said Rosneft's status as representative of the government in output-sharing deals was unclear and he was unsure of its effect on stalled projects.\\nOne of the Russian sources said Rosneft had once been in preliminary talks with Exxon Corp, Amoco Corp and Total of France on possible strategic alliances but that talks could not proceed until Rosneft's fate was decided.\\n\\\"For the (international) majors, Rosneft is not a hypothetical partner now,\\\" the source said.\\nBerezovsky, through Rosneft's new, government-appointed president, Yuri Bespalov, has undertaken a sweeping overhaul of Rosneft managers, replacing half a dozen powerful department heads, including Valentin Zlatov, who oversaw exports. Rosneft vice-presidents and deputy chairmen are no longer empowered to conduct negotiations with foreign partners or to sign contracts.\\nSources said Sibneft, whose main production unit is Noyabrskneftegaz, was positioning, possibly through an unknown affiliate, to place a winning bid for Rosneft in a forthcoming auction of the company's shares.\\n\\\"I keep hearing from many Russians that Berezovsky is definitely going for Rosneft,\\\" said the Western oil executive. \\\"There is a sense now that it's much more certain.\\\"\\nMoscow has held sales of prize stakes in privatised oil companies but nearly all of them have been won by what appear to be pre-determined winners allied with the company being sold.\\nThe original privatisation plan for Rosneft, Russia's 10th largest producer with 1996 output of 262,000 barrels per day, calls for 47 percent to be auctioned off. The state would retain 51 percent while workers would get two percent.\\nRosneft, which Moscow once envisioned as Russia's national oil company, has wanted to emulate the success of its private competitors, like LUKoil. Senior Rosneft officials once begged to be described as a private oil company, even though it is still 100 percent state-owned.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"JoeOrtiz\",\n          \"GrahamEarnshaw\",\n          \"MartinWolk\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"hopeful_test\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author_num\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 14,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 49,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          17\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
