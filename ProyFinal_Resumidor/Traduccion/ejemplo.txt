 The late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing
proportions: the headlong and furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering.
This enterprise has proceeded so rapidly—with so little outside commentary—that
its dimensions and implications are hardly understood at all.
 Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history. By the end of
this decade, it will have outdistanced atomic power and computers in its effect on
our everyday lives. In the words of one observer, “Biotechnology is going to
transform every aspect of human life: our medical care, our food, our health, our
entertainment, our very bodies. Nothing will ever be the same again. It’s literally
going to change the face of the planet.”
 But the biotechnology revolution differs in three important respects from past
scientific transformations.
 First, it is broad-based. America entered the atomic age through the work of a
single research institution, at Los Alamos. It entered the computer age through the
efforts of about a dozen companies. But biotechnology research is now carried out
in more than two thousand laboratories in America alone. Five hundred
corporations spend five billion dollars a year on this technology.
 Second, much of the research is thoughtless or frivolous. Efforts to engineer
paler trout for better visibility in the stream, square trees for easier lumbering,
and injectable scent cells so you’ll always smell of your favorite perfume may seem
like a joke, but they are not. Indeed, the fact that biotechnology can be applied to
the industries traditionally subject to the vagaries of fashion, such as cosmetics
and leisure activities, heightens concern about the whimsical use of this powerful
new technology.
 Third, the work is uncontrolled. No one supervises it. No federal laws regulate it.
There is no coherent government policy, in America or anywhere else in the world.
And because the products of biotechnology range from drugs to farm crops to
artificial snow, an intelligent policy is difficult.
 But most disturbing is the fact that no watchdogs are found among scientists
themselves. It is remarkable that nearly every scientist in genetics research is also
engaged in the commerce of biotechnology. There are no detached observers.
Everybody has a stake.
 The commercialization of molecular biology is the most stunning ethical event in
the history of science, and it has happened with astonishing speed. For four
hundred years since Galileo, science has always proceeded as a free and open
inquiry into the workings of nature. Scientists have always ignored national
boundaries, holding themselves above the transitory concerns of politics and even
wars. Scientists have always rebelled against secrecy in research, and have even
frowned on the idea of patenting their discoveries, seeing themselves as working to
the benefit of all mankind. And for many generations, the discoveries of scientists
did indeed have a peculiarly selfless quality.
 When, in 1953, two young researchers in England, James Watson and Francis
Crick, deciphered the structure of DNA, their work was hailed as a triumph of the
human spirit, of the centuries-old quest to understand the universe in a scientific
way. It was confidently expected that their discovery would be selflessly extended
to the greater benefit of mankind.
 Yet that did not happen. Thirty years later, nearly all of Watson and Crick’s
scientific colleagues were engaged in another sort of enterprise entirely. Research
in molecular genetics had become a vast, multibillion-dollar commercial
undertaking, and its origins can be traced not to 1953 but to April 1976.
 That was the date of a now famous meeting, in which Robert Swanson, a
venture capitalist, approached Herbert Boyer, a biochemist at the University of
California. The two men agreed to found a commercial company to exploit Boyer’s
gene-splicing techniques. Their new company, Genentech, quickly became the
largest and most successful of the genetic engineering start-ups.
 Suddenly it seemed as if everyone wanted to become rich. New companies were
announced almost weekly, and scientists flocked to exploit genetic research. By
1986, at least 362 scientists, including 64 in the National Academy, sat on the
advisory boards of biotech firms. The number of those who held equity positions or
consultancies was several times greater.
 It is necessary to emphasize how significant this shift in attitude actually was.
In the past, pure scientists took a snobbish view of business. They saw the pursuit
of money as intellectually uninteresting, suited only to shopkeepers. And to do
research for industry, even at the prestigious Bell or IBM labs, was only for those
who couldn’t get a university appointment. Thus the attitude of pure scientists
was fundamentally critical toward the work of applied scientists, and to industry
in general. Their long-standing antagonism kept university scientists free of
contaminating industry ties, and whenever debate arose about technological
matters, disinterested scientists were available to discuss the issues at the highest
levels.
 But that is no longer true. There are very few molecular biologists and very few
research institutions without commercial affiliations. The old days are gone.
Genetic research continues, at a more furious pace than ever. But it is done in
secret, and in haste, and for profit.
 In this commercial climate, it is probably inevitable that a company as
ambitious as International Genetic Technologies, Inc., of Palo Alto, would arise. It
is equally unsurprising that the genetic crisis it created should go unreported.
After all, InGen’s research was conducted in secret; the actual incident occurred in
the most remote region of Central America; and fewer than twenty people were
there to witness it. Of those, only a handful survived.
 Even at the end, when International Genetic Technologies filed for Chapter 11
protection in United States Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco on October 5,
1989, the proceedings drew little press attention. It appeared so ordinary: InGen
was the third small American bioengineering company to fail that year, and the
seventh since 1986. Few court documents were made public, since the creditors
were Japanese investment consortia, such as Hamaguri and Densaka, companies
which traditionally shun publicity. To avoid unnecessary disclosure, Daniel Ross,
of Cowan, Swain and Ross, counsel for InGen, also represented the Japanese
investors. And the rather unusual petition of the vice consul of Costa Rica was
heard behind closed doors. Thus it is not surprising that, within a month, the
problems of InGen were quietly and amicably settled.
 Parties to that settlement, including the distinguished scientific board of
advisers, signed a nondisclosure agreement, and none will speak about what
happened; but many of the principal figures in the “InGen incident” are not
signatories, and were willing to discuss the remarkable events leading up to those
final two days in August 1989 on a remote island off the west coast of Costa Rica.
The tropical rain fell in drenching sheets, hammering the corrugated roof of the
clinic building, roaring down the metal gutters, splashing on the ground in a
torrent. Roberta Carter sighed, and stared out the window. From the clinic, she
could hardly see the beach or the ocean beyond, cloaked in low fog. This wasn’t
what she had expected when she had come to the fishing village of Bahía Anasco,
on the west coast of Costa Rica, to spend two months as a visiting physician.
Bobbie Carter had expected sun and relaxation, after two grueling years of
residency in emergency medicine at Michael Reese in Chicago.
 She had been in Bahía Anasco now for three weeks. And it had rained every
day.
 Everything else was fine. She liked the isolation of Bahía Anasco, and the
friendliness of its people. Costa Rica had one of the twenty best medical systems
in the world, and even in this remote coastal village, the clinic was well
maintained, amply supplied. Her paramedic, Manuel Aragón, was intelligent and
well trained. Bobbie was able to practice a level of medicine equal to what she had
practiced in Chicago.
 But the rain! The constant, unending rain!
 Across the examining room, Manuel cocked his head. “Listen,” he said.
 “Believe me, I hear it,” Bobbie said.
 “No. Listen.”
 And then she caught it, another sound blended with the rain, a deeper rumble
that built and emerged until it was clear: the rhythmic thumping of a helicopter.
She thought, They can’t be flying in weather like this.
 But the sound built steadily, and then the helicopter burst low through the
ocean fog and roared overhead, circled, and came back. She saw the helicopter
swing back over the water, near the fishing boats, then ease sideways to the
rickety wooden dock, and back toward the beach.
 It was looking for a place to land.
 It was a big-bellied Sikorsky with a blue stripe on the side, with the words
“InGen Construction.” That was the name of the construction company building a
new resort on one of the offshore islands. The resort was said to be spectacular,
and very complicated; many of the local people were employed in the construction,
which had been going on for more than two years. Bobbie could imagine it—one of
those huge American resorts with swimming pools and tennis courts, where
guests could play and drink their daiquiris, without having any contact with the
real life of the country.
 Bobbie wondered what was so urgent on that island that the helicopter would
fly in this weather. Through the windshield she saw the pilot exhale in relief as the
helicopter settled onto the wet sand of the beach. Uniformed men jumped out, and
flung open the big side door. She heard frantic shouts in Spanish, and Manuel
nudged her.
 They were calling for a doctor.
Two black crewmen carried a limp body toward her, while a white man barked
orders. The white man had a yellow slicker. Red hair appeared around the edges of
his Mets baseball cap. “Is there a doctor here?” he called to her, as she ran up.
 “I’m Dr. Carter,” she said. The rain fell in heavy drops, pounding her head and
shoulders. The red-haired man frowned at her. She was wearing cut-off jeans and
a tank top. She had a stethoscope over her shoulder, the bell already rusted from
the salt air.
 “Ed Regis. We’ve got a very sick man here, doctor.”
 “Then you better take him to San José,” she said. San José was the capital, just
twenty minutes away by air.
 “We would, but we can’t get over the mountains in this weather. You have to
treat him here.”
 Bobbie trotted alongside the injured man as they carried him to the clinic. He
was a kid, no older than eighteen. Lifting away the blood-soaked shirt, she saw a
big slashing rip along his shoulder, and another on the leg.
 “What happened to him?”
 “Construction accident,” Ed shouted. “He fell. One of the backhoes ran over
him.”
 The kid was pale, shivering, unconscious.
 Manuel stood by the bright green door of the clinic, waving his arm. The men
brought the body through and set it on the table in the center of the room. Manuel
started an intravenous line, and Bobbie swung the light over the kid and bent to
examine the wounds. Immediately she could see that it did not look good. The kid
would almost certainly die.
 A big tearing laceration ran from his shoulder down his torso. At the edge of the
wound, the flesh was shredded. At the center, the shoulder was dislocated, pale
bones exposed. A second slash cut through the heavy muscles of the thigh, deep
enough to reveal the pulse of the femoral artery below. Her first impression was
that his leg had been ripped open.
 “Tell me again about this injury,” she said.
 “I didn’t see it,” Ed said. “They say the backhoe dragged him.”
 “Because it almost looks as if he was mauled,” Bobbie Carter said, probing the
wound. Like most emergency room physicians, she could remember in detail
patients she had seen even years before. She had seen two maulings. One was a
two-year-old child who had been attacked by a rottweiler dog. The other was a
drunken circus attendant who had had an encounter with a Bengal tiger. Both
injuries were similar. There was a characteristic look to an animal attack.
 “Mauled?” Ed said. “No, no. It was a backhoe, believe me.” Ed licked his lips as
he spoke. He was edgy, acting as if he had done something wrong. Bobbie
wondered why. If they were using inexperienced local workmen on the resort
construction, they must have accidents all the time.
 Manuel said, “Do you want lavage?”
 “Yes,” she said. “After you block him.”
 She bent lower, probed the wound with her fingertips. If an earth mover had
rolled over him, dirt would be forced deep into the wound. But there wasn’t any
dirt, just a slippery, slimy foam. And the wound had a strange odor, a kind of
rotten stench, a smell of death and decay. She had never smelled anything like it
before.
 “How long ago did this happen?”
 “An hour.”
 Again she noticed how tense Ed Regis was. He was one of those eager, nervous
types. And he didn’t look like a construction foreman. More like an executive. He
was obviously out of his depth.
 Bobbie Carter turned back to the injuries. Somehow she didn’t think she was
seeing mechanical trauma. It just didn’t look right. No soil contamination of the
wound site, and no crush-injury component. Mechanical trauma of any sort—an
auto injury, a factory accident—almost always had some component of crushing.
But here there was none. Instead, the man’s skin was shredded—ripped—across
his shoulder, and again across his thigh.
 It really did look like a maul. On the other hand, most of the body was
unmarked, which was unusual for an animal attack. She looked again at the
head, the arms, the hands—
 The hands.
 She felt a chill when she looked at the kid’s hands. There were short slashing
cuts on both palms, and bruises on the wrists and forearms. She had worked in
Chicago long enough to know what that meant.
 “All right,” she said. “Wait outside.”
 “Why?” Ed said, alarmed. He didn’t like that.
 “Do you want me to help him, or not?” she said, and pushed him out the door
and closed it on his face. She didn’t know what was going on, but she didn’t like it.
Manuel hesitated. “I continue to wash?”
 “Yes,” she said. She reached for her little Olympus point-and-shoot. She took
several snapshots of the injury, shifting her light for a better view. It really did look
like bites, she thought. Then the kid groaned, and she put her camera aside and
bent toward him. His lips moved, his tongue thick.
 “Raptor,” he said. “Lo sa raptor…”
 At those words, Manuel froze, stepped back in horror.
 “What does it mean?” Bobbie said.
 Manuel shook his head. “I do not know, doctor. Lo sa raptor—no es español.”
 “No?” It sounded to her like Spanish. “Then please continue to wash him.”
 “No, doctor.” He wrinkled his nose. “Bad smell.” And he crossed himself.
 Bobbie looked again at the slippery foam streaked across the wound. She
touched it, rubbing it between her fingers. It seemed almost like saliva…
 The injured boy’s lips moved. “Raptor,” he whispered.
 In a tone of horror, Manuel said, “It bit him.”
 “What bit him?”
 “Raptor.”
 “What’s a raptor?”
 “It means hupia.”
 Bobbie frowned. The Costa Ricans were not especially superstitious, but she
had heard the hupia mentioned in the village before. They were said to be night
ghosts, faceless vampires who kidnapped small children. According to the belief,
the hupia had once lived in the mountains of Costa Rica, but now inhabited the
islands offshore.
 Manuel was backing away, murmuring and crossing himself. “It is not normal,
this smell,” he said. “It is the hupia.”
 Bobbie was about to order him back to work when the injured youth opened his
eyes and sat straight up on the table. Manuel shrieked in terror. The injured boy
moaned and twisted his head, looking left and right with wide staring eyes, and
then he explosively vomited blood. He went immediately into convulsions, his body
vibrating, and Bobbie grabbed for him but he shuddered off the table onto the
concrete floor. He vomited again. There was blood everywhere. Ed opened the door,
saying, “What the hell’s happening?” and when he saw the blood he turned away,
his hand to his mouth. Bobbie was grabbing for a stick to put in the boy’s
clenched jaws, but even as she did it she knew it was hopeless, and with a final
spastic jerk he relaxed and lay still.
 She bent to perform mouth-to-mouth, but Manuel grabbed her shoulder
fiercely, pulling her back. “No,” he said. “The hupia will cross over.”
 “Manuel, for God’s sake—”
 “No.” He stared at her fiercely. “No. You do not understand these things.”
 Bobbie looked at the body on the ground and realized that it didn’t matter; there
was no possibility of resuscitating him. Manuel called for the men, who came back
into the room and took the body away. Ed appeared, wiping his mouth with the
back of his hand, muttering, “I’m sure you did all you could,” and then she
watched as the men took the body away, back to the helicopter, and it lifted
thunderously up into the sky.
 “It is better,” Manuel said.
 Bobbie was thinking about the boy’s hands. They had been covered with cuts
and bruises, in the characteristic pattern of defense wounds. She was quite sure
he had not died in a construction accident; he had been attacked, and he had held
up his hands against his attacker. “Where is this island they’ve come from?” she
asked.
 “In the ocean. Perhaps a hundred, hundred and twenty miles offshore.”
 “Pretty far for a resort,” she said.
 Manuel watched the helicopter. “I hope they never come back.”
 Well, she thought, at least she had pictures. But when she turned back to the
table, she saw that her camera was gone.
 The rain finally stopped later that night. Alone in the bedroom behind the clinic,
Bobbie thumbed through her tattered paperback Spanish dictionary. The boy had
said “raptor,” and, despite Manuel’s protests, she suspected it was a Spanish
word. Sure enough, she found it in her dictionary. It meant “ravisher” or
“abductor.”
 That gave her pause. The sense of the word was suspiciously close to the
meaning of hupia. Of course she did not believe in the superstition. And no ghost
had cut those hands. What had the boy been trying to tell her?
 From the next room, she heard groans. One of the village women was in the first
stage of labor, and Elena Morales, the local midwife, was attending her. Bobbie
went into the clinic room and gestured to Elena to step outside for a moment.
 “Elena…”
 “Sí, doctor?”
 “Do you know what is a raptor?”
 Elena was gray-haired and sixty, a strong woman with a practical, no-nonsense
air. In the night, beneath the stars, she frowned and said, “Raptor?”
 “Yes. You know this word?”
 “Sí.” Elena nodded. “It means… a person who comes in the night and takes
away a child.”
 “A kidnapper?”
 “Yes.”
 “A hupia?”
 Her whole manner changed. “Do not say this word, doctor.”
 “Why not?”
 “Do not speak of hupia now,” Elena said firmly, nodding her head toward the
groans of the laboring woman. “It is not wise to say this word now.”
 “But does a raptor bite and cut his victims?”
 “Bite and cut?” Elena said, puzzled. “No, doctor. Nothing like this. A raptor is a
man who takes a new baby.” She seemed irritated by the conversation, impatient
to end it. Elena started back toward the clinic. “I will call to you when she is ready,
doctor. I think one hour more, perhaps two.”
 Bobbie looked at the stars, and listened to the peaceful lapping of the surf at the
shore. In the darkness she saw the shadows of the fishing boats anchored
offshore. The whole scene was quiet, so normal, she felt foolish to be talking of
vampires and kidnapped babies.
 Bobbie went back to her room, remembering again that Manuel had insisted it
was not a Spanish word. Out of curiosity, she looked in the little English
dictionary, and to her surprise she found the word there, too:
raptor\n [deriv. of L. raptor plunderer, fr. raptus]: bird of prey.
