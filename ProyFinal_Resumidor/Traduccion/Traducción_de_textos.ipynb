            " The late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing proportions: the headlong and furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering. This enterprise has proceeded so rapidly—with so little outside commentary—that its dimensions and implications are hardly understood at all.  Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history. By the end of this decade, it will have outdistanced atomic power and computers in its effect on our everyday lives. In the words of one observer, “Biotechnology is going to transform every aspect of human life: our medical care, our food, our health, our entertainment, our very bodies. Nothing will ever be the same again. It’s literally going to change the face of the planet.”  But the biotechnology revolution differs in three important respects from past scientific transformations.  First, it is broad-based. America entered the atomic age through the work of a single research institution, at Los Alamos. It entered the computer age through the efforts of about a dozen companies. But biotechnology research is now carried out in more than two thousand laboratories in America alone. Five hundred corporations spend five billion dollars a year on this technology.  Second, much of the research is thoughtless or frivolous. Efforts to engineer paler trout for better visibility in the stream, square trees for easier lumbering, and injectable scent cells so you’ll always smell of your favorite perfume may seem like a joke, but they are not. Indeed, the fact that biotechnology can be applied to the industries traditionally subject to the vagaries of fashion, such as cosmetics and leisure activities, heightens concern about the whimsical use of this powerful new technology.  Third, the work is uncontrolled. No one supervises it. No federal laws regulate it. There is no coherent government policy, in America or anywhere else in the world. And because the products of biotechnology range from drugs to farm crops to artificial snow, an intelligent policy is difficult.  But most disturbing is the fact that no watchdogs are found among scientists themselves. It is remarkable that nearly every scientist in genetics research is also engaged in the commerce of biotechnology. There are no detached observers. Everybody has a stake.  The commercialization of molecular biology is the most stunning ethical event in the history of science, and it has happened with astonishing speed. For four hundred years since Galileo, science has always proceeded as a free and open inquiry into the workings of nature. Scientists have always ignored national boundaries, holding themselves above the transitory concerns of politics and even wars. Scientists have always rebelled against secrecy in research, and have even frowned on the idea of patenting their discoveries, seeing themselves as working to the benefit of all mankind. And for many generations, the discoveries of scientists did indeed have a peculiarly selfless quality.  When, in 1953, two young researchers in England, James Watson and Francis Crick, deciphered the structure of DNA, their work was hailed as a triumph of the human spirit, of the centuries-old quest to understand the universe in a scientific way. It was confidently expected that their discovery would be selflessly extended to the greater benefit of mankind.  Yet that did not happen. Thirty years later, nearly all of Watson and Crick’s scientific colleagues were engaged in another sort of enterprise entirely. Research in molecular genetics had become a vast, multibillion-dollar commercial undertaking, and its origins can be traced not to 1953 but to April 1976.  That was the date of a now famous meeting, in which Robert Swanson, a venture capitalist, approached Herbert Boyer, a biochemist at the University of California. The two men agreed to found a commercial company to exploit Boyer’s gene-splicing techniques. Their new company, Genentech, quickly became the largest and most successful of the genetic engineering start-ups.  Suddenly it seemed as if everyone wanted to become rich. New companies were announced almost weekly, and scientists flocked to exploit genetic research. By 1986, at least 362 scientists, including 64 in the National Academy, sat on the advisory boards of biotech firms. The number of those who held equity positions or consultancies was several times greater.  It is necessary to emphasize how significant this shift in attitude actually was. In the past, pure scientists took a snobbish view of business. They saw the pursuit of money as intellectually uninteresting, suited only to shopkeepers. And to do research for industry, even at the prestigious Bell or IBM labs, was only for those who couldn’t get a university appointment. Thus the attitude of pure scientists was fundamentally critical toward the work of applied scientists, and to industry in general. Their long-standing antagonism kept university scientists free of contaminating industry ties, and whenever debate arose about technological matters, disinterested scientists were available to discuss the issues at the highest levels.  But that is no longer true. There are very few molecular biologists and very few research institutions without commercial affiliations. The old days are gone. Genetic research continues, at a more furious pace than ever. But it is done in secret, and in haste, and for profit.  In this commercial climate, it is probably inevitable that a company as ambitious as International Genetic Technologies, Inc., of Palo Alto, would arise. It is equally unsurprising that the genetic crisis it created should go unreported. After all, InGen’s research was conducted in secret; the actual incident occurred in the most remote region of Central America; and fewer than twenty people were there to witness it. Of those, only a handful survived.  Even at the end, when International Genetic Technologies filed for Chapter 11 protection in United States Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco on October 5, 1989, the proceedings drew little press attention. It appeared so ordinary: InGen was the third small American bioengineering company to fail that year, and the seventh since 1986. Few court documents were made public, since the creditors were Japanese investment consortia, such as Hamaguri and Densaka, companies which traditionally shun publicity. To avoid unnecessary disclosure, Daniel Ross, of Cowan, Swain and Ross, counsel for InGen, also represented the Japanese investors. And the rather unusual petition of the vice consul of Costa Rica was heard behind closed doors. Thus it is not surprising that, within a month, the problems of InGen were quietly and amicably settled.  Parties to that settlement, including the distinguished scientific board of advisers, signed a nondisclosure agreement, and none will speak about what happened; but many of the principal figures in the “InGen incident” are not signatories, and were willing to discuss the remarkable events leading up to those final two days in August 1989 on a remote island off the west coast of Costa Rica. The tropical rain fell in drenching sheets, hammering the corrugated roof of the clinic building, roaring down the metal gutters, splashing on the ground in a torrent. Roberta Carter sighed, and stared out the window. From the clinic, she could hardly see the beach or the ocean beyond, cloaked in low fog. This wasn’t what she had expected when she had come to the fishing village of Bahía Anasco, on the west coast of Costa Rica, to spend two months as a visiting physician. Bobbie Carter had expected sun and relaxation, after two grueling years of residency in emergency medicine at Michael Reese in Chicago.  She had been in Bahía Anasco now for three weeks. And it had rained every day.  Everything else was fine. She liked the isolation of Bahía Anasco, and the friendliness of its people. Costa Rica had one of the twenty best medical systems in the world, and even in this remote coastal village, the clinic was well maintained, amply supplied. Her paramedic, Manuel Aragón, was intelligent and well trained. Bobbie was able to practice a level of medicine equal to what she had practiced in Chicago.  But the rain! The constant, unending rain!  Across the examining room, Manuel cocked his head. “Listen,” he said.  “Believe me, I hear it,” Bobbie said.  “No. Listen.”  And then she caught it, another sound blended with the rain, a deeper rumble that built and emerged until it was clear: the rhythmic thumping of a helicopter. She thought, They can’t be flying in weather like this.  But the sound built steadily, and then the helicopter burst low through the ocean fog and roared overhead, circled, and came back. She saw the helicopter swing back over the water, near the fishing boats, then ease sideways to the rickety wooden dock, and back toward the beach.  It was looking for a place to land.  It was a big-bellied Sikorsky with a blue stripe on the side, with the words “InGen Construction.” That was the name of the construction company building a new resort on one of the offshore islands. The resort was said to be spectacular, and very complicated; many of the local people were employed in the construction, which had been going on for more than two years. Bobbie could imagine it—one of those huge American resorts with swimming pools and tennis courts, where guests could play and drink their daiquiris, without having any contact with the real life of the country.  Bobbie wondered what was so urgent on that island that the helicopter would fly in this weather. Through the windshield she saw the pilot exhale in relief as the helicopter settled onto the wet sand of the beach. Uniformed men jumped out, and flung open the big side door. She heard frantic shouts in Spanish, and Manuel nudged her.  They were calling for a doctor. Two black crewmen carried a limp body toward her, while a white man barked orders. The white man had a yellow slicker. Red hair appeared around the edges of his Mets baseball cap. “Is there a doctor here?” he called to her, as she ran up.  “I’m Dr. Carter,” she said. The rain fell in heavy drops, pounding her head and shoulders. The red-haired man frowned at her. She was wearing cut-off jeans and a tank top. She had a stethoscope over her shoulder, the bell already rusted from the salt air.  “Ed Regis. We’ve got a very sick man here, doctor.”  “Then you better take him to San José,” she said. San José was the capital, just twenty minutes away by air.  “We would, but we can’t get over the mountains in this weather. You have to treat him here.”  Bobbie trotted alongside the injured man as they carried him to the clinic. He was a kid, no older than eighteen. Lifting away the blood-soaked shirt, she saw a big slashing rip along his shoulder, and another on the leg.  “What happened to him?”  “Construction accident,” Ed shouted. “He fell. One of the backhoes ran over him.”  The kid was pale, shivering, unconscious.  Manuel stood by the bright green door of the clinic, waving his arm. The men brought the body through and set it on the table in the center of the room. Manuel started an intravenous line, and Bobbie swung the light over the kid and bent to examine the wounds. Immediately she could see that it did not look good. The kid would almost certainly die.  A big tearing laceration ran from his shoulder down his torso. At the edge of the wound, the flesh was shredded. At the center, the shoulder was dislocated, pale bones exposed. A second slash cut through the heavy muscles of the thigh, deep enough to reveal the pulse of the femoral artery below. Her first impression was that his leg had been ripped open.  “Tell me again about this injury,” she said.  “I didn’t see it,” Ed said. “They say the backhoe dragged him.”  “Because it almost looks as if he was mauled,” Bobbie Carter said, probing the wound. Like most emergency room physicians, she could remember in detail patients she had seen even years before. She had seen two maulings. One was a two-year-old child who had been attacked by a rottweiler dog. The other was a drunken circus attendant who had had an encounter with a Bengal tiger. Both injuries were similar. There was a characteristic look to an animal attack.  “Mauled?” Ed said. “No, no. It was a backhoe, believe me.” Ed licked his lips as he spoke. He was edgy, acting as if he had done something wrong. Bobbie wondered why. If they were using inexperienced local workmen on the resort construction, they must have accidents all the time.  Manuel said, “Do you want lavage?”  “Yes,” she said. “After you block him.”  She bent lower, probed the wound with her fingertips. If an earth mover had rolled over him, dirt would be forced deep into the wound. But there wasn’t any dirt, just a slippery, slimy foam. And the wound had a strange odor, a kind of rotten stench, a smell of death and decay. She had never smelled anything like it before.  “How long ago did this happen?”  “An hour.”  Again she noticed how tense Ed Regis was. He was one of those eager, nervous types. And he didn’t look like a construction foreman. More like an executive. He was obviously out of his depth.  Bobbie Carter turned back to the injuries. Somehow she didn’t think she was seeing mechanical trauma. It just didn’t look right. No soil contamination of the wound site, and no crush-injury component. Mechanical trauma of any sort—an auto injury, a factory accident—almost always had some component of crushing. But here there was none. Instead, the man’s skin was shredded—ripped—across his shoulder, and again across his thigh.  It really did look like a maul. On the other hand, most of the body was unmarked, which was unusual for an animal attack. She looked again at the head, the arms, the hands—  The hands.  She felt a chill when she looked at the kid’s hands. There were short slashing cuts on both palms, and bruises on the wrists and forearms. She had worked in Chicago long enough to know what that meant.  “All right,” she said. “Wait outside.”  “Why?” Ed said, alarmed. He didn’t like that.  “Do you want me to help him, or not?” she said, and pushed him out the door and closed it on his face. She didn’t know what was going on, but she didn’t like it. Manuel hesitated. “I continue to wash?”  “Yes,” she said. She reached for her little Olympus point-and-shoot. She took several snapshots of the injury, shifting her light for a better view. It really did look like bites, she thought. Then the kid groaned, and she put her camera aside and bent toward him. His lips moved, his tongue thick.  “Raptor,” he said. “Lo sa raptor…”  At those words, Manuel froze, stepped back in horror.  “What does it mean?” Bobbie said.  Manuel shook his head. “I do not know, doctor. Lo sa raptor—no es español.”  “No?” It sounded to her like Spanish. “Then please continue to wash him.”  “No, doctor.” He wrinkled his nose. “Bad smell.” And he crossed himself.  Bobbie looked again at the slippery foam streaked across the wound. She touched it, rubbing it between her fingers. It seemed almost like saliva…  The injured boy’s lips moved. “Raptor,” he whispered.  In a tone of horror, Manuel said, “It bit him.”  “What bit him?”  “Raptor.”  “What’s a raptor?”  “It means hupia.”  Bobbie frowned. The Costa Ricans were not especially superstitious, but she had heard the hupia mentioned in the village before. They were said to be night ghosts, faceless vampires who kidnapped small children. According to the belief, the hupia had once lived in the mountains of Costa Rica, but now inhabited the islands offshore.  Manuel was backing away, murmuring and crossing himself. “It is not normal, this smell,” he said. “It is the hupia.”  Bobbie was about to order him back to work when the injured youth opened his eyes and sat straight up on the table. Manuel shrieked in terror. The injured boy moaned and twisted his head, looking left and right with wide staring eyes, and then he explosively vomited blood. He went immediately into convulsions, his body vibrating, and Bobbie grabbed for him but he shuddered off the table onto the concrete floor. He vomited again. There was blood everywhere. Ed opened the door, saying, “What the hell’s happening?” and when he saw the blood he turned away, his hand to his mouth. Bobbie was grabbing for a stick to put in the boy’s clenched jaws, but even as she did it she knew it was hopeless, and with a final spastic jerk he relaxed and lay still.  She bent to perform mouth-to-mouth, but Manuel grabbed her shoulder fiercely, pulling her back. “No,” he said. “The hupia will cross over.”  “Manuel, for God’s sake—”  “No.” He stared at her fiercely. “No. You do not understand these things.”  Bobbie looked at the body on the ground and realized that it didn’t matter; there was no possibility of resuscitating him. Manuel called for the men, who came back into the room and took the body away. Ed appeared, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, muttering, “I’m sure you did all you could,” and then she watched as the men took the body away, back to the helicopter, and it lifted thunderously up into the sky.  “It is better,” Manuel said.  Bobbie was thinking about the boy’s hands. They had been covered with cuts and bruises, in the characteristic pattern of defense wounds. She was quite sure he had not died in a construction accident; he had been attacked, and he had held up his hands against his attacker. “Where is this island they’ve come from?” she asked.  “In the ocean. Perhaps a hundred, hundred and twenty miles offshore.”  “Pretty far for a resort,” she said.  Manuel watched the helicopter. “I hope they never come back.”  Well, she thought, at least she had pictures. But when she turned back to the table, she saw that her camera was gone.  The rain finally stopped later that night. Alone in the bedroom behind the clinic, Bobbie thumbed through her tattered paperback Spanish dictionary. The boy had said “raptor,” and, despite Manuel’s protests, she suspected it was a Spanish word. Sure enough, she found it in her dictionary. It meant “ravisher” or “abductor.”  That gave her pause. The sense of the word was suspiciously close to the meaning of hupia. Of course she did not believe in the superstition. And no ghost had cut those hands. What had the boy been trying to tell her?  From the next room, she heard groans. One of the village women was in the first stage of labor, and Elena Morales, the local midwife, was attending her. Bobbie went into the clinic room and gestured to Elena to step outside for a moment.  “Elena…”  “Sí, doctor?”  “Do you know what is a raptor?”  Elena was gray-haired and sixty, a strong woman with a practical, no-nonsense air. In the night, beneath the stars, she frowned and said, “Raptor?”  “Yes. You know this word?”  “Sí.” Elena nodded. “It means… a person who comes in the night and takes away a child.”  “A kidnapper?”  “Yes.”  “A hupia?”  Her whole manner changed. “Do not say this word, doctor.”  “Why not?”  “Do not speak of hupia now,” Elena said firmly, nodding her head toward the groans of the laboring woman. “It is not wise to say this word now.”  “But does a raptor bite and cut his victims?”  “Bite and cut?” Elena said, puzzled. “No, doctor. Nothing like this. A raptor is a man who takes a new baby.” She seemed irritated by the conversation, impatient to end it. Elena started back toward the clinic. “I will call to you when she is ready, doctor. I think one hour more, perhaps two.”  Bobbie looked at the stars, and listened to the peaceful lapping of the surf at the shore. In the darkness she saw the shadows of the fishing boats anchored offshore. The whole scene was quiet, so normal, she felt foolish to be talking of vampires and kidnapped babies.  Bobbie went back to her room, remembering again that Manuel had insisted it was not a Spanish word. Out of curiosity, she looked in the little English dictionary, and to her surprise she found the word there, too: raptor\\n [deriv. of L. raptor plunderer, fr. raptus]: bird of prey. \n"

After all, InGen’s research was conducted in secret; the actual incident occurred in the most remote region of Central America; and fewer than twenty people were there to witness it. Of those, only a handful survived.  Even at the end, when International Genetic Technologies filed for Chapter 11 protection in United States Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco on October 5, 1989, the proceedings drew little press attention. It appeared so ordinary: InGen was the third small American bioengineering company to fail that year, and the seventh since 1986. Few court documents were made public, since the creditors were Japanese investment consortia, such as Hamaguri and Densaka, companies which traditionally shun publicity. To avoid unnecessary disclosure, Daniel Ross, of Cowan, Swain and Ross, counsel for InGen, also represented the Japanese investors. And the rather unusual petition of the vice consul of Costa Rica was heard behind closed doors. Thus it is not surprising that, within a month, the problems of InGen were quietly and amicably settled.  Parties to that settlement, including the distinguished scientific board of advisers, signed a nondisclosure agreement, and none will speak about what happened; but many of the principal figures in the “InGen incident” are not signatories, and were willing to discuss the remarkable events leading up to those final two days in August 1989 on a remote island off the west coast of Costa Rica. The tropical rain fell in drenching sheets, hammering the corrugated roof of the clinic building, roaring down the metal gutters, splashing on the ground in a torrent. Roberta Carter sighed, and stared out the window. From the clinic, she could hardly see the beach or the ocean beyond, cloaked in low fog. This wasn’t what she had expected when she had come to the fishing village of Bahía Anasco, on the west coast of Costa Rica, to spend two months as a visiting physician. Bobbie Carter had expected sun and relaxation, after two grueling years of residency in emergency medicine at Michael Reese in Chicago.  She had been in Bahía Anasco now for three weeks. And it had rained every day.  Everything else was fine. She liked the isolation of Bahía Anasco, and the friendliness of its people. Costa Rica had one of the twenty best medical systems in the world, and even in this remote coastal village, the clinic was well maintained, amply supplied. Her paramedic, Manuel Aragón, was intelligent and well trained. Bobbie was able to practice a level of medicine equal to what she had practiced in Chicago.  But the rain! The constant, unending rain!  Across the examining room, Manuel cocked his head. “Listen,” he said.  “Believe me, I hear it,” Bobbie said.  “No. Listen.”  And then she caught it, another sound blended with the rain, a deeper rumble that built and emerged until it was clear: the rhythmic thumping of a helicopter. She thought, They can’t be flying in weather like this.  But the sound built steadily, and then the helicopter burst low through the ocean fog and roared overhead, circled, and came back. She saw the helicopter swing back over the water, near the fishing boats, then ease sideways to the rickety wooden dock, and back toward the beach.  It was looking for a place to land.  It was a big-bellied Sikorsky with a blue stripe on the side, with the words “InGen Construction.” That was the name of the construction company building a new resort on one of the offshore islands. The resort was said to be spectacular, and very complicated; many of the local people were employed in the construction, which had been going on for more than two years. Bobbie could imagine it—one of those huge American resorts with swimming pools and tennis courts, where guests could play and drink their daiquiris, without having any contact with the real life of the country.  Bobbie wondered what was so urgent on that island that the helicopter would fly in this weather. Through the windshield she saw the pilot exhale in relief as the helicopter settled onto the wet sand of the beach. Uniformed men jumped out, and flung open the big side door. She heard frantic shouts in Spanish, and Manuel nudged her.  They were calling for a doctor. Two black crewmen carried a limp body toward her, while a white man barked orders. The white man had a yellow slicker. Red hair appeared around the edges of his Mets baseball cap. “Is there a doctor here?” he called to her, as she ran up.  “I’m Dr. Carter,” she said. The rain fell in heavy drops, pounding her head and shoulders. The red-haired man frowned at her. She was wearing cut-off jeans and a tank top. She had a stethoscope over her shoulder, the bell already rusted from the salt air.  “Ed Regis. We’ve got a very sick man here, doctor.”  “Then you better take him to San José,” she said. San José was the capital, just twenty minutes away by air.  “We would, but we can’t get over the mountains in this weather. You have to treat him here.”  Bobbie trotted alongside the injured man as they carried him to the clinic. He was a kid, no older than eighteen. Lifting away the blood-soaked shirt, she saw a big slashing rip along his shoulder, and another on the leg.  “What happened to him?”  “Construction accident,” Ed shouted. “He fell. One of the backhoes ran over him.”  The kid was pale, shivering, unconscious.  Manuel stood by the bright green door of the clinic, waving his arm. The men brought the body through and set it on the table in the center of the room. Manuel started an intravenous line, and Bobbie swung the light over the kid and bent to examine the wounds. Immediately she could see that it did not look good. The kid would almost certainly die.  A big tearing laceration ran from his shoulder down his torso. At the edge of the wound, the flesh was shredded. At the center, the shoulder was dislocated, pale bones exposed. A second slash cut through the heavy muscles of the thigh, deep enough to reveal the pulse of the femoral artery below. Her first impression was that his leg had been ripped open.  “Tell me again about this injury,” she said.  “I didn’t see it,” Ed said. “They say the backhoe dragged him.”  “Because it almost looks as if he was mauled,” Bobbie Carter said, probing the wound. Like most emergency room physicians, she could remember in detail patients she had seen even years before. She had seen two maulings. One was a two-year-old child who had been attacked by a rottweiler dog. The other was a drunken circus attendant who had had an encounter with a Bengal tiger. Both injuries were similar. There was a characteristic look to an animal attack.  “Mauled?” Ed said. “No, no. It was a backhoe, believe me.” Ed licked his lips as he spoke. He was edgy, acting as if he had done something wrong. Bobbie wondered why. If they were using inexperienced local workmen on the resort construction, they must have accidents all the time.  Manuel said, “Do you want lavage?”  “Yes,” she said. “After you block him.”  She bent lower, probed the wound with her fingertips. If an earth mover had rolled over him, dirt would be forced deep into the wound. But there wasn’t any dirt, just a slippery, slimy foam. And the wound had a strange odor, a kind of rotten stench, a smell of death and decay. She had never smelled anything like it before.  “How long ago did this happen?”  “An hour.”  Again she noticed how tense Ed Regis was. He was one of those eager, nervous types. And he didn’t look like a construction foreman. More like an executive. He was obviously out of his depth.  Bobbie Carter turned back to the injuries. Somehow she didn’t think she was seeing mechanical trauma. It just didn’t look right. No soil contamination of the wound site, and no crush-injury component. Mechanical trauma of any sort—an auto injury, a factory accident—almost always had some component of crushing. But here there was none. Instead, the man’s skin was shredded—ripped—across his shoulder, and again across his thigh.  It really did look like a maul. On the other hand, most of the body was unmarked, which was unusual for an animal attack. She looked again at the head, the arms, the hands—  The hands.  She felt a chill when she looked at the kid’s hands. There were short slashing cuts on both palms, and bruises on the wrists and forearms.\n",

            "She had worked in Chicago long enough to know what that meant.  “All right,” she said. “Wait outside.”  “Why?” Ed said, alarmed. He didn’t like that.  “Do you want me to help him, or not?” she said, and pushed him out the door and closed it on his face. She didn’t know what was going on, but she didn’t like it. Manuel hesitated. “I continue to wash?”  “Yes,” she said. She reached for her little Olympus point-and-shoot. She took several snapshots of the injury, shifting her light for a better view. It really did look like bites, she thought. Then the kid groaned, and she put her camera aside and bent toward him. His lips moved, his tongue thick.  “Raptor,” he said. “Lo sa raptor…”  At those words, Manuel froze, stepped back in horror.  “What does it mean?” Bobbie said.  Manuel shook his head. “I do not know, doctor. Lo sa raptor—no es español.”  “No?” It sounded to her like Spanish. “Then please continue to wash him.”  “No, doctor.” He wrinkled his nose. “Bad smell.” And he crossed himself.  Bobbie looked again at the slippery foam streaked across the wound. She touched it, rubbing it between her fingers. It seemed almost like saliva…  The injured boy’s lips moved. “Raptor,” he whispered.  In a tone of horror, Manuel said, “It bit him.”  “What bit him?”  “Raptor.”  “What’s a raptor?”  “It means hupia.”  Bobbie frowned. The Costa Ricans were not especially superstitious, but she had heard the hupia mentioned in the village before. They were said to be night ghosts, faceless vampires who kidnapped small children. According to the belief, the hupia had once lived in the mountains of Costa Rica, but now inhabited the islands offshore.  Manuel was backing away, murmuring and crossing himself. “It is not normal, this smell,” he said. “It is the hupia.”  Bobbie was about to order him back to work when the injured youth opened his eyes and sat straight up on the table. Manuel shrieked in terror. The injured boy moaned and twisted his head, looking left and right with wide staring eyes, and then he explosively vomited blood. He went immediately into convulsions, his body vibrating, and Bobbie grabbed for him but he shuddered off the table onto the concrete floor. He vomited again. There was blood everywhere. Ed opened the door, saying, “What the hell’s happening?” and when he saw the blood he turned away, his hand to his mouth. Bobbie was grabbing for a stick to put in the boy’s clenched jaws, but even as she did it she knew it was hopeless, and with a final spastic jerk he relaxed and lay still.  She bent to perform mouth-to-mouth, but Manuel grabbed her shoulder fiercely, pulling her back. “No,” he said. “The hupia will cross over.”  “Manuel, for God’s sake—”  “No.” He stared at her fiercely. “No. You do not understand these things.”  Bobbie looked at the body on the ground and realized that it didn’t matter; there was no possibility of resuscitating him. Manuel called for the men, who came back into the room and took the body away. Ed appeared, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, muttering, “I’m sure you did all you could,” and then she watched as the men took the body away, back to the helicopter, and it lifted thunderously up into the sky.  “It is better,” Manuel said.  Bobbie was thinking about the boy’s hands. They had been covered with cuts and bruises, in the characteristic pattern of defense wounds. She was quite sure he had not died in a construction accident; he had been attacked, and he had held up his hands against his attacker. “Where is this island they’ve come from?” she asked.  “In the ocean. Perhaps a hundred, hundred and twenty miles offshore.”  “Pretty far for a resort,” she said.  Manuel watched the helicopter. “I hope they never come back.”  Well, she thought, at least she had pictures. But when she turned back to the table, she saw that her camera was gone.  The rain finally stopped later that night. Alone in the bedroom behind the clinic, Bobbie thumbed through her tattered paperback Spanish dictionary. The boy had said “raptor,” and, despite Manuel’s protests, she suspected it was a Spanish word. Sure enough, she found it in her dictionary. It meant “ravisher” or “abductor.”  That gave her pause. The sense of the word was suspiciously close to the meaning of hupia. Of course she did not believe in the superstition. And no ghost had cut those hands. What had the boy been trying to tell her?  From the next room, she heard groans. One of the village women was in the first stage of labor, and Elena Morales, the local midwife, was attending her. Bobbie went into the clinic room and gestured to Elena to step outside for a moment.  “Elena…”  “Sí, doctor?”  “Do you know what is a raptor?”  Elena was gray-haired and sixty, a strong woman with a practical, no-nonsense air. In the night, beneath the stars, she frowned and said, “Raptor?”  “Yes. You know this word?”  “Sí.” Elena nodded. “It means… a person who comes in the night and takes away a child.”  “A kidnapper?”  “Yes.”  “A hupia?”  Her whole manner changed. “Do not say this word, doctor.”  “Why not?”  “Do not speak of hupia now,” Elena said firmly, nodding her head toward the groans of the laboring woman. “It is not wise to say this word now.”  “But does a raptor bite and cut his victims?”  “Bite and cut?” Elena said, puzzled. “No, doctor. Nothing like this. A raptor is a man who takes a new baby.” She seemed irritated by the conversation, impatient to end it. Elena started back toward the clinic. “I will call to you when she is ready, doctor. I think one hour more, perhaps two.”  Bobbie looked at the stars, and listened to the peaceful lapping of the surf at the shore. In the darkness she saw the shadows of the fishing boats anchored offshore. The whole scene was quiet, so normal, she felt foolish to be talking of vampires and kidnapped babies.  Bobbie went back to her room, remembering again that Manuel had insisted it was not a Spanish word. Out of curiosity, she looked in the little English dictionary, and to her surprise she found the word there, too: raptor\\n [deriv. of L. raptor plunderer, fr. raptus]: bird of prey. .\n",

            "The late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing proportions: the headlong and furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering. This enterprise has proceeded so rapidly—with so little outside commentary—that its dimensions and implications are hardly understood at all.  Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history. By the end of this decade, it will have outdistanced atomic power and computers in its effect on our everyday lives. In the words of one observer, “Biotechnology is going to transform every aspect of human life: our medical care, our food, our health, our entertainment, our very bodies. Nothing will ever be the same again. It’s literally going to change the face of the planet.”  But the biotechnology revolution differs in three important respects from past scientific transformations.  First, it is broad-based. America entered the atomic age through the work of a single research institution, at Los Alamos. It entered the computer age through the efforts of about a dozen companies. But biotechnology research is now carried out in more than two thousand laboratories in America alone. Five hundred corporations spend five billion dollars a year on this technology.  Second, much of the research is thoughtless or frivolous. Efforts to engineer paler trout for better visibility in the stream, square trees for easier lumbering, and injectable scent cells so you’ll always smell of your favorite perfume may seem like a joke, but they are not. Indeed, the fact that biotechnology can be applied to the industries traditionally subject to the vagaries of fashion, such as cosmetics and leisure activities, heightens concern about the whimsical use of this powerful new technology.  Third, the work is uncontrolled. No one supervises it. No federal laws regulate it. There is no coherent government policy, in America or anywhere else in the world. And because the products of biotechnology range from drugs to farm crops to artificial snow, an intelligent policy is difficult.  But most disturbing is the fact that no watchdogs are found among scientists themselves. It is remarkable that nearly every scientist in genetics research is also engaged in the commerce of biotechnology. There are no detached observers. Everybody has a stake.  The commercialization of molecular biology is the most stunning ethical event in the history of science, and it has happened with astonishing speed. For four hundred years since Galileo, science has always proceeded as a free and open inquiry into the workings of nature. Scientists have always ignored national boundaries, holding themselves above the transitory concerns of politics and even wars. Scientists have always rebelled against secrecy in research, and have even frowned on the idea of patenting their discoveries, seeing themselves as working to the benefit of all mankind. And for many generations, the discoveries of scientists did indeed have a peculiarly selfless quality.  When, in 1953, two young researchers in England, James Watson and Francis Crick, deciphered the structure of DNA, their work was hailed as a triumph of the human spirit, of the centuries-old quest to understand the universe in a scientific way. It was confidently expected that their discovery would be selflessly extended to the greater benefit of mankind.  Yet that did not happen. Thirty years later, nearly all of Watson and Crick’s scientific colleagues were engaged in another sort of enterprise entirely. Research in molecular genetics had become a vast, multibillion-dollar commercial undertaking, and its origins can be traced not to 1953 but to April 1976.  That was the date of a now famous meeting, in which Robert Swanson, a venture capitalist, approached Herbert Boyer, a biochemist at the University of California. The two men agreed to found a commercial company to exploit Boyer’s gene-splicing techniques. Their new company, Genentech, quickly became the largest and most successful of the genetic engineering start-ups.  Suddenly it seemed as if everyone wanted to become rich. New companies were announced almost weekly, and scientists flocked to exploit genetic research. By 1986, at least 362 scientists, including 64 in the National Academy, sat on the advisory boards of biotech firms. The number of those who held equity positions or consultancies was several times greater.  It is necessary to emphasize how significant this shift in attitude actually was. In the past, pure scientists took a snobbish view of business. They saw the pursuit of money as intellectually uninteresting, suited only to shopkeepers. And to do research for industry, even at the prestigious Bell or IBM labs, was only for those who couldn’t get a university appointment. Thus the attitude of pure scientists was fundamentally critical toward the work of applied scientists, and to industry in general. Their long-standing antagonism kept university scientists free of contaminating industry ties, and whenever debate arose about technological matters, disinterested scientists were available to discuss the issues at the highest levels.  But that is no longer true. There are very few molecular biologists and very few research institutions without commercial affiliations. The old days are gone. Genetic research continues, at a more furious pace than ever. But it is done in secret, and in haste, and for profit.  In this commercial climate, it is probably inevitable that a company as ambitious as International Genetic Technologies, Inc., of Palo Alto, would arise. It is equally unsurprising that the genetic crisis it created should go unreported. After all, InGen’s research was conducted in secret; the actual incident occurred in the most remote region of Central America; and fewer than twenty people were there to witness it. Of those, only a handful survived.  Even at the end, when International Genetic Technologies filed for Chapter 11 protection in United States Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco on October 5, 1989, the proceedings drew little press attention. It appeared so ordinary: InGen was the third small American bioengineering company to fail that year, and the seventh since 1986. Few court documents were made public, since the creditors were Japanese investment consortia, such as Hamaguri and Densaka, companies which traditionally shun publicity. To avoid unnecessary disclosure, Daniel Ross, of Cowan, Swain and Ross, counsel for InGen, also represented the Japanese investors. And the rather unusual petition of the vice consul of Costa Rica was heard behind closed doors. Thus it is not surprising that, within a month, the problems of InGen were quietly and amicably settled.  Parties to that settlement, including the distinguished scientific board of advisers, signed a nondisclosure agreement, and none will speak about what happened; but many of the principal figures in the “InGen incident” are not signatories, and were willing to discuss the remarkable events leading up to those final two days in August 1989 on a remote island off the west coast of Costa Rica. The tropical rain fell in drenching sheets, hammering the corrugated roof of the clinic building, roaring down the metal gutters, splashing on the ground in a torrent. Roberta Carter sighed, and stared out the window. From the clinic, she could hardly see the beach or the ocean beyond, cloaked in low fog. This wasn’t what she had expected when she had come to the fishing village of Bahía Anasco, on the west coast of Costa Rica, to spend two months as a visiting physician. Bobbie Carter had expected sun and relaxation, after two grueling years of residency in emergency medicine at Michael Reese in Chicago.  She had been in Bahía Anasco now for three weeks. And it had rained every day.  Everything else was fine. She liked the isolation of Bahía Anasco, and the friendliness of its people. Costa Rica had one of the twenty best medical systems in the world, and even in this remote coastal village, the clinic was well maintained, amply supplied. Her paramedic, Manuel Aragón, was intelligent and well trained. Bobbie was able to practice a level of medicine equal to what she had practiced in Chicago.  But the rain! The constant, unending rain!  Across the examining room, Manuel cocked his head. “Listen,” he said.  “Believe me, I hear it,” Bobbie said.  “No. Listen.”  And then she caught it, another sound blended with the rain, a deeper rumble that built and emerged until it was clear: the rhythmic thumping of a helicopter. She thought, They can’t be flying in weather like this.  But the sound built steadily, and then the helicopter burst low through the ocean fog and roared overhead, circled, and came back. She saw the helicopter swing back over the water, near the fishing boats, then ease sideways to the rickety wooden dock, and back toward the beach.  It was looking for a place to land.  It was a big-bellied Sikorsky with a blue stripe on the side, with the words “InGen Construction.” That was the name of the construction company building a new resort on one of the offshore islands. The resort was said to be spectacular, and very complicated; many of the local people were employed in the construction, which had been going on for more than two years. Bobbie could imagine it—one of those huge American resorts with swimming pools and tennis courts, where guests could play and drink their daiquiris, without having any contact with the real life of the country.  Bobbie wondered what was so urgent on that island that the helicopter would fly in this weather. Through the windshield she saw the pilot exhale in relief as the helicopter settled onto the wet sand of the beach. Uniformed men jumped out, and flung open the big side door. She heard frantic shouts in Spanish, and Manuel nudged her.  They were calling for a doctor. Two black crewmen carried a limp body toward her, while a white man barked orders.

The rain fell in heavy drops, pounding her head and shoulders. The red-haired man frowned at her. She was wearing cut-off jeans and a tank top. She had a stethoscope over her shoulder, the bell already rusted from the salt air.  “Ed Regis. We’ve got a very sick man here, doctor.”  “Then you better take him to San José,” she said. San José was the capital, just twenty minutes away by air.  “We would, but we can’t get over the mountains in this weather. You have to treat him here.”  Bobbie trotted alongside the injured man as they carried him to the clinic. He was a kid, no older than eighteen. Lifting away the blood-soaked shirt, she saw a big slashing rip along his shoulder, and another on the leg.  “What happened to him?”  “Construction accident,” Ed shouted. “He fell. One of the backhoes ran over him.”  The kid was pale, shivering, unconscious.  Manuel stood by the bright green door of the clinic, waving his arm. The men brought the body through and set it on the table in the center of the room. Manuel started an intravenous line, and Bobbie swung the light over the kid and bent to examine the wounds. Immediately she could see that it did not look good. The kid would almost certainly die.  A big tearing laceration ran from his shoulder down his torso. At the edge of the wound, the flesh was shredded. At the center, the shoulder was dislocated, pale bones exposed. A second slash cut through the heavy muscles of the thigh, deep enough to reveal the pulse of the femoral artery below. Her first impression was that his leg had been ripped open.  “Tell me again about this injury,” she said.  “I didn’t see it,” Ed said. “They say the backhoe dragged him.”  “Because it almost looks as if he was mauled,” Bobbie Carter said, probing the wound. Like most emergency room physicians, she could remember in detail patients she had seen even years before. She had seen two maulings. One was a two-year-old child who had been attacked by a rottweiler dog. The other was a drunken circus attendant who had had an encounter with a Bengal tiger. Both injuries were similar. There was a characteristic look to an animal attack.  “Mauled?” Ed said. “No, no. It was a backhoe, believe me.” Ed licked his lips as he spoke. He was edgy, acting as if he had done something wrong. Bobbie wondered why. If they were using inexperienced local workmen on the resort construction, they must have accidents all the time.  Manuel said, “Do you want lavage?”  “Yes,” she said. “After you block him.”  She bent lower, probed the wound with her fingertips. If an earth mover had rolled over him, dirt would be forced deep into the wound. But there wasn’t any dirt, just a slippery, slimy foam. And the wound had a strange odor, a kind of rotten stench, a smell of death and decay. She had never smelled anything like it before.  “How long ago did this happen?”  “An hour.”  Again she noticed how tense Ed Regis was. He was one of those eager, nervous types. And he didn’t look like a construction foreman. More like an executive. He was obviously out of his depth.  Bobbie Carter turned back to the injuries. Somehow she didn’t think she was seeing mechanical trauma. It just didn’t look right. No soil contamination of the wound site, and no crush-injury component. Mechanical trauma of any sort—an auto injury, a factory accident—almost always had some component of crushing. But here there was none. Instead, the man’s skin was shredded—ripped—across his shoulder, and again across his thigh.  It really did look like a maul. On the other hand, most of the body was unmarked, which was unusual for an animal attack. She looked again at the head, the arms, the hands—  The hands.  She felt a chill when she looked at the kid’s hands. There were short slashing cuts on both palms, and bruises on the wrists and forearms.\n",
            "El final del siglo XX ha sido testigo de una fiebre del oro científico de proporciones asombrosas: la precipitada y furiosa prisa por comercializar la ingeniería genética. Esta empresa ha avanzado tan rápidamente –con tan pocos comentarios externos– que apenas se comprenden sus dimensiones e implicaciones. La biotecnología promete la mayor revolución en la historia de la humanidad. Para finales de esta década, habrá superado a la energía atómica y a las computadoras en sus efectos en nuestra vida cotidiana. En palabras de un observador, “la biotecnología va a transformar todos los aspectos de la vida humana: nuestra atención médica, nuestra alimentación, nuestra salud, nuestro entretenimiento, nuestros propios cuerpos. Nada será lo mismo otra vez. Literalmente va a cambiar la faz del planeta”. Pero la revolución biotecnológica difiere en tres aspectos importantes de las transformaciones científicas pasadas. En primer lugar, tiene una base amplia. Estados Unidos entró en la era atómica gracias al trabajo de una única institución de investigación, en Los Álamos. Entró en la era de la informática gracias a los esfuerzos de una docena de empresas. Pero la investigación biotecnológica se lleva a cabo actualmente en más de dos mil laboratorios sólo en Estados Unidos. Quinientas corporaciones gastan cinco mil millones de dólares al año en esta tecnología. En segundo lugar, gran parte de la investigación es irreflexiva o frívola. Los esfuerzos por diseñar truchas más pálidas para una mejor visibilidad en el arroyo, árboles cuadrados para facilitar el transporte y células aromáticas inyectables para que siempre huelas a tu perfume favorito pueden parecer una broma, pero no lo son. De hecho, el hecho de que la biotecnología pueda aplicarse a industrias tradicionalmente sujetas a los caprichos de la moda, como la cosmética y las actividades de ocio, aumenta la preocupación por el uso caprichoso de esta nueva y poderosa tecnología. En tercer lugar, el trabajo no está controlado. Nadie lo supervisa. Ninguna ley federal lo regula. No existe una política gubernamental coherente, ni en Estados Unidos ni en ningún otro lugar del mundo. Y como los productos de la biotecnología van desde medicamentos hasta cultivos agrícolas y nieve artificial, es difícil adoptar una política inteligente. Pero lo más inquietante es el hecho de que no se encuentran perros guardianes entre los propios científicos. Es notable que casi todos los científicos que se dedican a la investigación genética también se dedican al comercio de la biotecnología. No hay observadores imparciales. Todo el mundo tiene algo en juego. La comercialización de la biología molecular es el acontecimiento ético más sorprendente en la historia de la ciencia y ha ocurrido a una velocidad asombrosa. Durante cuatrocientos años desde Galileo, la ciencia siempre ha procedido como una investigación libre y abierta del funcionamiento de la naturaleza. Los científicos siempre han ignorado las fronteras nacionales, manteniéndose por encima de las preocupaciones transitorias de la política e incluso de las guerras. Los científicos siempre se han rebelado contra el secreto en la investigación e incluso han desaprobado la idea de patentar sus descubrimientos, considerándose que trabajan en beneficio de toda la humanidad. Y durante muchas generaciones, los descubrimientos de los científicos tuvieron efectivamente una cualidad peculiarmente desinteresada. Cuando, en 1953, dos jóvenes investigadores en Inglaterra, James Watson y Francis Crick, descifraron la estructura del ADN, su trabajo fue aclamado como un triunfo del espíritu humano, de la búsqueda centenaria de comprender el universo de manera científica. Se esperaba con confianza que su descubrimiento se extendiera desinteresadamente en beneficio de la humanidad. Sin embargo, eso no sucedió. Treinta años después, casi todos los colegas científicos de Watson y Crick estaban comprometidos en un tipo de empresa completamente diferente. La investigación en genética molecular se había convertido en una enorme empresa comercial multimillonaria, y sus orígenes no se remontan a 1953 sino a abril de 1976. Esa fue la fecha de una reunión ahora famosa, en la que Robert Swanson, un capitalista de riesgo, se acercó a Herbert Boyer, bioquímico de la Universidad de California. Los dos hombres acordaron fundar una empresa comercial para explotar las técnicas de empalme de genes de Boyer. Su nueva empresa, Genentech, se convirtió rápidamente en la mayor y más exitosa de las empresas emergentes de ingeniería genética. De repente parecía como si todo el mundo quisiera hacerse rico. Casi semanalmente se anunciaban nuevas empresas y los científicos acudían en masa para explotar la investigación genética. En 1986, al menos 362 científicos, incluidos 64 de la Academia Nacional, formaban parte de los consejos asesores de las empresas de biotecnología. El número de quienes ocupaban puestos de capital o consultoría era varias veces mayor. Es necesario enfatizar cuán significativo fue en realidad este cambio de actitud. En el pasado, los científicos puros tenían una visión esnob de los negocios. Consideraban que la búsqueda de dinero carecía de interés intelectual y que sólo era adecuada para los comerciantes. Y hacer investigación para la industria, incluso en los prestigiosos laboratorios Bell o IBM, era sólo para aquellos que no podían conseguir un puesto en la universidad. Así, la actitud de los científicos puros fue fundamentalmente crítica hacia el trabajo de los científicos aplicados y hacia la industria en general. Su antagonismo de larga data mantuvo a los científicos universitarios libres de vínculos industriales contaminantes, y siempre que surgía un debate sobre cuestiones tecnológicas, había científicos desinteresados ​​disponibles para discutir los temas en los niveles más altos. Pero eso ya no es cierto. Hay muy pocos biólogos moleculares y muy pocas instituciones de investigación sin afiliaciones comerciales. Los viejos tiempos ya pasaron. La investigación genética continúa, a un ritmo más vertiginoso que nunca. Pero se hace en secreto, con prisa y con ánimo de lucro. En este clima comercial, probablemente sea inevitable que surja una empresa tan ambiciosa como International Genetic Technologies, Inc., de Palo Alto. Tampoco sorprende que la crisis genética que creó no se informe. Después de todo, la investigación de InGen se llevó a cabo en secreto; el incidente real ocurrió en la región más remota de Centroamérica; y menos de veinte personas estaban allí para presenciarlo. De ellos, sólo un puñado sobrevivió. Incluso al final, cuando International Genetic Technologies solicitó la protección del Capítulo 11 en el Tribunal de Quiebras de los Estados Unidos en San Francisco el 5 de octubre de 1989, el procedimiento atrajo poca atención de la prensa. Parecía muy normal: InGen fue la tercera pequeña empresa estadounidense de bioingeniería que quebró ese año, y la séptima desde 1986. Se hicieron públicos pocos documentos judiciales, ya que los acreedores eran consorcios de inversión japoneses, como Hamaguri y Densaka, empresas que tradicionalmente evitan la publicidad. . Para evitar revelaciones innecesarias, Daniel Ross, de Cowan, Swain and Ross, abogado de InGen, también representó a los inversores japoneses. Y la petición bastante inusual del vicecónsul de Costa Rica se escuchó a puerta cerrada. Por lo tanto, no sorprende que, al cabo de un mes, los problemas de InGen se resolvieran de forma silenciosa y amistosa. Las partes de ese acuerdo, incluida la distinguida junta científica de asesores, firmaron un acuerdo de confidencialidad y ninguna hablará sobre lo sucedido; pero muchas de las principales figuras del “incidente de InGen” no son signatarios y estaban dispuestas a discutir los notables acontecimientos que precedieron a aquellos dos últimos días de agosto de 1989 en una remota isla frente a la costa occidental de Costa Rica. La lluvia tropical caía a cántaros, golpeando el tejado ondulado del edificio de la clínica, rugiendo por los canalones metálicos y salpicando el suelo a torrentes. Roberta Carter suspiró y miró por la ventana. Desde la clínica, apenas podía ver la playa o el océano más allá, envueltos en una niebla baja. Esto no era lo que esperaba cuando llegó al pueblo pesquero de Bahía Anasco, en la costa oeste de Costa Rica, para pasar dos meses como médico visitante. Bobbie Carter esperaba sol y relajación, después de dos agotadores años de residencia en medicina de emergencia en Michael Reese en Chicago. Ya llevaba tres semanas en Bahía Anasco. Y había llovido todos los días. Todo lo demás estuvo bien. Le gustaba el aislamiento de Bahía Anasco y la amabilidad de su gente. Costa Rica tenía uno de los veinte mejores sistemas médicos del mundo, e incluso en este remoto pueblo costero, la clínica estaba bien mantenida y ampliamente abastecida. Su paramédico, Manuel Aragón, era inteligente y estaba bien capacitado. Bobbie pudo ejercer un nivel de medicina igual al que había practicado en Chicago. ¡Pero la lluvia! ¡La lluvia constante e interminable! Al otro lado de la sala de examen, Manuel ladeó la cabeza. \"Escucha\", dijo. “Créame, lo escucho”, dijo Bobbie. \"No. Escuchar.\" Y entonces lo captó, otro sonido mezclado con la lluvia, un estruendo más profundo que fue creciendo y emergiendo hasta que quedó claro: el golpe rítmico de un helicóptero. Ella pensó: No pueden volar con un clima como este. Pero el sonido fue aumentando constantemente, y luego el helicóptero atravesó la niebla del océano y rugió sobre nosotros, dio vueltas y regresó. Vio que el helicóptero retrocedía sobre el agua, cerca de los barcos de pesca, luego se deslizaba hacia un lado hasta el desvencijado muelle de madera y regresaba a la playa. Estaba buscando un lugar para aterrizar. Era una Sikorsky de gran barriga con una franja azul en el costado y las palabras “InGen Construction”. Ese era el nombre de la empresa constructora que estaba construyendo un nuevo complejo en una de las islas costeras. Se decía que el complejo era espectacular y muy complicado; gran parte de la población local trabajó en la construcción, que duró más de dos años. Bobbie podía imaginarlo: uno de esos enormes complejos turísticos estadounidenses con piscinas y canchas de tenis, donde los huéspedes podían jugar y beber daiquiris, sin tener ningún contacto con la vida real del país. Bobbie se preguntó qué era tan urgente en esa isla para que el helicóptero volara con ese clima. A través del parabrisas vio al piloto exhalar aliviado mientras el helicóptero se posaba en la arena mojada de la playa. Unos hombres uniformados saltaron del vehículo y abrieron la gran puerta lateral. Escuchó gritos frenéticos en español y Manuel le dio un codazo. Estaban llamando a un médico. Dos tripulantes negros cargaron un cuerpo inerte hacia ella, mientras un hombre blanco ladraba órdenes. El hombre blanco tenía un impermeable amarillo. Pelo rojo apareció alrededor de los bordes de su gorra de béisbol de los Mets. \"¿Hay un médico aquí?\" él la llamó mientras ella corría. “Soy el Dr. Carter”, dijo. La lluvia caía en fuertes gotas, golpeándole la cabeza y los hombros. El pelirrojo le frunció el ceño. Llevaba unos vaqueros cortados y una camiseta sin mangas. Llevaba un estetoscopio al hombro y la campana ya estaba oxidada por el aire salado. “Ed Regis. Tenemos aquí a un hombre muy enfermo, doctor. “Entonces será mejor que lo lleves a San José”, dijo. San José era la capital, a sólo veinte minutos por aire. “Lo haríamos, pero no podemos cruzar las montañas con este clima. Tienes que tratarlo aquí”. Bobbie trotó junto al herido mientras lo llevaban a la clínica. Era un niño, no mayor de dieciocho años. Levantando la camisa empapada de sangre, vio un gran corte a lo largo de su hombro y otro en la pierna. \"¿Lo que le sucedió?\" \"Accidente de construcción\", gritó Ed. \"Se cayó. Una de las retroexcavadoras lo atropelló”. El niño estaba pálido, temblando, inconsciente. Manuel estaba junto a la puerta verde brillante de la clínica, agitando el brazo. Los hombres trajeron el cuerpo y lo colocaron sobre la mesa en el centro de la habitación. Manuel puso una vía intravenosa y Bobbie enfocó la luz sobre el niño y se inclinó para examinar las heridas. Inmediatamente pudo ver que no se veía bien. Es casi seguro que el niño moriría. Una gran laceración desgarradora le corría desde el hombro hasta el torso. En el borde de la herida, la carne estaba desgarrada. En el centro, el hombro estaba dislocado y los huesos pálidos quedaban al descubierto. Un segundo corte atravesó los pesados ​​músculos del muslo, lo suficientemente profundo como para revelar el pulso de la arteria femoral que se encontraba debajo. Su primera impresión fue que le habían abierto la pierna. “Cuéntame otra vez sobre esta lesión”, dijo. \"No lo vi\", dijo Ed. “Dicen que lo arrastró la retroexcavadora”. \"Porque casi parece como si lo hubieran mutilado\", dijo Bobbie Carter, sondeando la herida. Como la mayoría de los médicos de urgencias, podía recordar en detalle a los pacientes que había visto incluso años antes. Había visto dos golpes. Uno de ellos era un niño de dos años que había sido atacado por un perro rottweiler. El otro era un asistente de circo borracho que había tenido un encuentro con un tigre de Bengala. Ambas lesiones fueron similares. Había un aspecto característico en el ataque de un animal. “¿Mutilado?” Dijo Ed. \"No no. Era una retroexcavadora, créanme”. Ed se humedeció los labios mientras hablaba. Estaba nervioso y actuaba como si hubiera hecho algo mal. Bobbie se preguntó por qué. Si utilizaron trabajadores locales sin experiencia en la construcción del complejo, deben tener accidentes todo el tiempo. Manuel dijo: “¿Quieres lavado?” \"Sí\", dijo ella. \"Después de que lo bloquees\". Se inclinó más y palpó la herida con las yemas de los dedos. Si una excavadora hubiera pasado por encima de él, la tierra habría penetrado profundamente en la herida. Pero no había suciedad, sólo una espuma resbaladiza y viscosa. Y la herida tenía un olor extraño, una especie de hedor a podrido, un olor a muerte y descomposición. Nunca antes había olido algo así. “¿Hace cuánto tiempo sucedió esto?” \"Una hora.\" Nuevamente notó lo tenso que estaba Ed Regis. Era uno de esos tipos ansiosos y nerviosos. Y no parecía un capataz de construcción. Más bien un ejecutivo. Obviamente estaba fuera de su alcance. Bobbie Carter volvió a centrarse en las heridas. De alguna manera ella no pensó que estaba viendo un trauma mecánico. Simplemente no se veía bien. Sin contaminación del suelo en el lugar de la herida y sin componente de lesión por aplastamiento. Los traumatismos mecánicos de cualquier tipo (una lesión automovilística, un accidente de fábrica) casi siempre tenían algún componente de aplastamiento. Pero aquí no había ninguno. En cambio, la piel del hombre estaba desgarrada (desgarrada) a lo largo de su hombro y nuevamente a lo largo de su muslo. Realmente parecía un mazo. Por otro lado, la mayor parte del cuerpo no tenía marcas, lo cual era inusual en un ataque animal. Miró de nuevo la cabeza, los brazos, las manos... Las manos. Sintió un escalofrío cuando miró las manos del niño. Había cortes cortos en ambas palmas y hematomas en las muñecas y los antebrazos.\n",

            "She had worked in Chicago long enough to know what that meant.  “All right,” she said. “Wait outside.”  “Why?” Ed said, alarmed. He didn’t like that.  “Do you want me to help him, or not?” she said, and pushed him out the door and closed it on his face. She didn’t know what was going on, but she didn’t like it. Manuel hesitated. “I continue to wash?”  “Yes,” she said. She reached for her little Olympus point-and-shoot. She took several snapshots of the injury, shifting her light for a better view. It really did look like bites, she thought. Then the kid groaned, and she put her camera aside and bent toward him. His lips moved, his tongue thick.  “Raptor,” he said. “Lo sa raptor…”  At those words, Manuel froze, stepped back in horror.  “What does it mean?” Bobbie said.  Manuel shook his head. “I do not know, doctor. Lo sa raptor—no es español.”  “No?” It sounded to her like Spanish. “Then please continue to wash him.”  “No, doctor.” He wrinkled his nose. “Bad smell.” And he crossed himself.  Bobbie looked again at the slippery foam streaked across the wound. She touched it, rubbing it between her fingers. It seemed almost like saliva…  The injured boy’s lips moved. “Raptor,” he whispered.  In a tone of horror, Manuel said, “It bit him.”  “What bit him?”  “Raptor.”  “What’s a raptor?”  “It means hupia.”  Bobbie frowned. The Costa Ricans were not especially superstitious, but she had heard the hupia mentioned in the village before. They were said to be night ghosts, faceless vampires who kidnapped small children. According to the belief, the hupia had once lived in the mountains of Costa Rica, but now inhabited the islands offshore.  Manuel was backing away, murmuring and crossing himself. “It is not normal, this smell,” he said. “It is the hupia.”  Bobbie was about to order him back to work when the injured youth opened his eyes and sat straight up on the table. Manuel shrieked in terror. The injured boy moaned and twisted his head, looking left and right with wide staring eyes, and then he explosively vomited blood. He went immediately into convulsions, his body vibrating, and Bobbie grabbed for him but he shuddered off the table onto the concrete floor. He vomited again. There was blood everywhere. Ed opened the door, saying, “What the hell’s happening?” and when he saw the blood he turned away, his hand to his mouth. Bobbie was grabbing for a stick to put in the boy’s clenched jaws, but even as she did it she knew it was hopeless, and with a final spastic jerk he relaxed and lay still.  She bent to perform mouth-to-mouth, but Manuel grabbed her shoulder fiercely, pulling her back. “No,” he said. “The hupia will cross over.”  “Manuel, for God’s sake—”  “No.” He stared at her fiercely. “No. You do not understand these things.”  Bobbie looked at the body on the ground and realized that it didn’t matter; there was no possibility of resuscitating him. Manuel called for the men, who came back into the room and took the body away. Ed appeared, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, muttering, “I’m sure you did all you could,” and then she watched as the men took the body away, back to the helicopter, and it lifted thunderously up into the sky.  “It is better,” Manuel said.  Bobbie was thinking about the boy’s hands. They had been covered with cuts and bruises, in the characteristic pattern of defense wounds. She was quite sure he had not died in a construction accident; he had been attacked, and he had held up his hands against his attacker. “Where is this island they’ve come from?” she asked.  “In the ocean. Perhaps a hundred, hundred and twenty miles offshore.”  “Pretty far for a resort,” she said.  Manuel watched the helicopter. “I hope they never come back.”  Well, she thought, at least she had pictures. But when she turned back to the table, she saw that her camera was gone.  The rain finally stopped later that night. Alone in the bedroom behind the clinic, Bobbie thumbed through her tattered paperback Spanish dictionary. The boy had said “raptor,” and, despite Manuel’s protests, she suspected it was a Spanish word. Sure enough, she found it in her dictionary. It meant “ravisher” or “abductor.”  That gave her pause. The sense of the word was suspiciously close to the meaning of hupia. Of course she did not believe in the superstition. And no ghost had cut those hands. What had the boy been trying to tell her?  From the next room, she heard groans. One of the village women was in the first stage of labor, and Elena Morales, the local midwife, was attending her. Bobbie went into the clinic room and gestured to Elena to step outside for a moment.  “Elena…”  “Sí, doctor?”  “Do you know what is a raptor?”  Elena was gray-haired and sixty, a strong woman with a practical, no-nonsense air. In the night, beneath the stars, she frowned and said, “Raptor?”  “Yes. You know this word?”  “Sí.” Elena nodded. “It means… a person who comes in the night and takes away a child.”  “A kidnapper?”  “Yes.”  “A hupia?”  Her whole manner changed. “Do not say this word, doctor.”  “Why not?”  “Do not speak of hupia now,” Elena said firmly, nodding her head toward the groans of the laboring woman. “It is not wise to say this word now.”  “But does a raptor bite and cut his victims?”  “Bite and cut?” Elena said, puzzled. “No, doctor. Nothing like this. A raptor is a man who takes a new baby.” She seemed irritated by the conversation, impatient to end it. Elena started back toward the clinic. “I will call to you when she is ready, doctor. I think one hour more, perhaps two.”  Bobbie looked at the stars, and listened to the peaceful lapping of the surf at the shore. In the darkness she saw the shadows of the fishing boats anchored offshore. The whole scene was quiet, so normal, she felt foolish to be talking of vampires and kidnapped babies.  Bobbie went back to her room, remembering again that Manuel had insisted it was not a Spanish word. Out of curiosity, she looked in the little English dictionary, and to her surprise she found the word there, too: raptor\\n [deriv. of L. raptor plunderer, fr. raptus]: bird of prey. .\n",
            "Había trabajado en Chicago el tiempo suficiente para saber lo que eso significaba. \"Está bien\", dijo. \"Espera afuera\". \"¿Por qué?\" Dijo Ed, alarmado. A él no le gustó eso. “¿Quieres que lo ayude o no?” dijo, y lo empujó hacia la puerta y se la cerró en la cara. Ella no sabía lo que estaba pasando, pero no le gustaba. Manuel vaciló. \"¿Sigo lavándome?\" \"Sí\", dijo ella. Cogió su pequeña Olympus de apuntar y disparar. Tomó varias fotografías de la lesión y movió la luz para ver mejor. Realmente parecían mordiscos, pensó. Entonces el niño gimió y ella dejó la cámara a un lado y se inclinó hacia él. Sus labios se movieron, su lengua espesa. \"Raptor\", dijo. “Lo sa raptor…” Ante esas palabras, Manuel se quedó helado y dio un paso atrás horrorizado. \"¿Qué significa?\" dijo Bobbie. Manuel negó con la cabeza. “No lo sé, doctor. Lo sa raptor—no es español”. \"¿No?\" A ella le sonó a español. \"Entonces, por favor, continúa lavándolo\". “No, doctor”. Arrugó la nariz. \"Mal olor.\" Y se santiguó. Bobbie volvió a mirar la espuma resbaladiza que cubría la herida. Lo tocó, frotándolo entre sus dedos. Parecía casi saliva… Los labios del chico herido se movieron. \"Raptor\", susurró. En tono de horror, Manuel dijo: “Lo mordió”. “¿Qué lo mordió?” \"Raptor\". “¿Qué es una rapaz?” “Significa hupia”. Bobbie frunció el ceño. Los costarricenses no eran especialmente supersticiosos, pero ella había oído mencionar la hupia en el pueblo antes. Se decía que eran fantasmas nocturnos, vampiros sin rostro que secuestraban a niños pequeños. Según la creencia, la hupia alguna vez vivió en las montañas de Costa Rica, pero ahora habitaba en las islas cercanas a la costa. Manuel retrocedía, murmuraba y se santiguaba. “Este olor no es normal”, dijo. “Es la hupia”. Bobbie estaba a punto de ordenarle que volviera a trabajar cuando el joven herido abrió los ojos y se sentó sobre la mesa. Manuel gritó aterrorizado. El niño herido gimió y giró la cabeza, mirando a izquierda y derecha con los ojos muy abiertos, y luego vomitó sangre explosivamente. Inmediatamente tuvo convulsiones, su cuerpo vibró y Bobbie lo agarró, pero él se estremeció y cayó al piso de concreto. Volvió a vomitar. Había sangre por todas partes. Ed abrió la puerta y dijo: \"¿Qué diablos está pasando?\" y cuando vio la sangre se volvió, con la mano en la boca. Bobbie estaba agarrando un palo para ponerlo en las apretadas mandíbulas del niño, pero incluso mientras lo hacía sabía que era inútil, y con un último tirón espástico él se relajó y se quedó quieto. Se inclinó para realizar el boca a boca, pero Manuel la agarró por el hombro con fuerza y ​​la empujó hacia atrás. \"No\", dijo. “La hupia cruzará”. “Manuel, por el amor de Dios…” “No”. Él la miró fijamente con fiereza. \"No. No entiendes estas cosas”. Bobbie miró el cuerpo en el suelo y se dio cuenta de que no importaba; no hubo posibilidad de resucitarlo. Manuel llamó a los hombres, quienes regresaron a la habitación y se llevaron el cuerpo. Apareció Ed, secándose la boca con el dorso de la mano y murmurando: \"Estoy segura de que hiciste todo lo que pudiste\", y luego vio cómo los hombres se llevaban el cuerpo, lo llevaban de regreso al helicóptero y este se elevaba estruendosamente hacia el cielo. el cielo. “Es mejor”, dijo Manuel. Bobbie estaba pensando en las manos del niño. Estaban cubiertos de cortes y magulladuras, siguiendo el patrón característico de las heridas de defensa. Estaba bastante segura de que no había muerto en un accidente de construcción; Lo habían atacado y había levantado las manos contra su atacante. “¿De dónde está esta isla de donde vienen?” ella preguntó. \"En el océano. Quizás a ciento veinte millas de la costa. \"Bastante lejos para ser un centro turístico\", dijo. Manuel observó el helicóptero. “Espero que nunca vuelvan”. Bueno, pensó, al menos tenía fotografías. Pero cuando volvió a la mesa, vio que su cámara había desaparecido. La lluvia finalmente paró esa misma noche. Sola en el dormitorio detrás de la clínica, Bobbie hojeaba su andrajoso diccionario de español de bolsillo. El niño había dicho \"raptor\" y, a pesar de las protestas de Manuel, ella sospechaba que era una palabra española. Efectivamente, lo encontró en su diccionario. Significaba \"violador\" o \"secuestrador\". Eso la hizo dudar. El sentido de la palabra se acercaba sospechosamente al significado de hupia. Por supuesto que ella no creía en la superstición. Y ningún fantasma había cortado esas manos. ¿Qué había estado tratando de decirle el chico? Desde la habitación de al lado escuchó gemidos. Una de las mujeres del pueblo estaba en la primera etapa del parto y Elena Morales, la partera local, la estaba atendiendo. Bobbie entró en la sala de la clínica y le indicó a Elena que saliera un momento. “Elena…” “¿Sí, doctor?” “¿Sabes qué es una rapaz?” Elena era canosa y tenía sesenta años, una mujer fuerte y de aire práctico y sensato. En la noche, bajo las estrellas, frunció el ceño y dijo: \"¿Raptor?\" \"Sí. ¿Conoces esta palabra? \"Si.\" Elena asintió. “Significa… una persona que llega por la noche y se lleva a un niño”. “¿Un secuestrador?” \"Sí.\" “¿Una hupia?” Todo su comportamiento cambió. \"No diga esta palabra, doctor\". \"¿Por qué no?\" “No hables de hupia ahora”, dijo Elena con firmeza, señalando con la cabeza los gemidos de la parturienta. \"No es prudente decir esta palabra ahora\". “¿Pero un ave rapaz muerde y corta a sus víctimas?” “¿Morder y cortar?” Elena dijo, desconcertada. “No, doctor. Nada como esto. Un ave rapaz es un hombre que toma un nuevo bebé”. Parecía irritada por la conversación, impaciente por ponerle fin. Elena emprendió el regreso a la clínica. “Le llamaré cuando esté lista, doctor. Creo que una hora más, tal vez dos”. Bobbie miró las estrellas y escuchó el pacífico batir de las olas en la orilla. En la oscuridad vio las sombras de los barcos pesqueros anclados en alta mar. Toda la escena estaba tranquila, tan normal que se sintió tonta por estar hablando de vampiros y bebés secuestrados. Bobbie regresó a su habitación y recordó nuevamente que Manuel había insistido en que no era una palabra en español. Por curiosidad, buscó en el pequeño diccionario de inglés y, para su sorpresa, encontró allí también la palabra: raptor\\n [derivada. de L. raptor saqueador, fr. raptus]: ave de rapiña. .\n",
